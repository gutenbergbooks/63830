  <h2 id='c3' class='c008'>3. OF HOMICIDE GENERALLY.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>To aid the administration of justice in cases of homicide
is not only the most useful, but the most frequent,
application of medical jurisprudence; this
subject, as well for its complexity as for its importance,
must be subdivided into many heads. It is first
necessary that the medical practitioner should determine
by examination, inspection, or dissection,
whether the matter ought to be referred to the criminal
tribunals, or whether the decease of the party is
to be attributed to any of those natural causes, which
are generally classed as “Death by the Visitation of
God.” In some instances this examination will take
place in aid of the coroner’s inquest, in others it will
be preparatory to it; in both cases it is equally important
that it should be minutely, faithfully, and
ably conducted; for it is on the medical report that
the first impressions will be founded, and the prejudices
created by it in the public mind may not easily
be effaced by any subsequent investigation. If, however,
it be determined that the cause of death has
been violent, it is then necessary to enquire to which
of the classes of homicide the act is to be attributed.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Homicide, properly so called, is either against a
man’s own life, or that of another.” 1 <i>Hawk. P. C.</i>
102.</p>

<p class='c000'>The first offence constitutes the crime of suicide or
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">felo de se</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>The second has many varieties; it may be justifiable,
excusable, or wilful; and this last again,
may be with, or without, malice prepense, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>constitutes the difference between manslaughter and
murder; both are felony, the one with,<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c011'><sup>[1]</sup></a> the other
without, the benefit of clergy; to these and their
numerous subdivisions we shall separately direct the
attention of our reader; having first, by a general
view of the physiology of death, and some practical
observations on the best modes of investigation, prepared
the way for a minuter examination of many of
those various modes of destruction to which human
life is liable.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>
  <h2 id='c4' class='c008'>OF REAL AND APPARENT DEATH.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'>If life be defined, that power by which organized
beings are enabled to resist the physical and chemical
operation of surrounding agents, it follows that death
must be marked by the occurrence of those phenomena
to which the elective attractions, no longer
suspended or controlled, will necessarily give rise;
hence putrefaction has been considered by many
authors as the only certain sign of dissolution; unfortunately,
however, this process of decomposition
does not immediately display its agency by visible
effects; the countenance has remained unchanged for
a considerable time after death, and cases have occurred
in which its colour and complexion have not
only been preserved, but even heightened. This difference
in the celerity with which the body putrefies
did not escape the observation of the ancients, and
like every other mysterious occurrence, was attributed
by them to divine interposition; we accordingly find
that their poets mentioned those who preserved the
appearance of freshness after death, as favoured persons,
who had fallen by the gentle darts of Apollo
and Diana; thus Hecuba<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c011'><sup>[2]</sup></a> declares that Hector, although
dead for twelve days, still remains fresh, like
one who had died by the hands of Apollo. On the
other hand, in certain morbid states of the living
frame, so feebly do the powers of life resist the operation
of physical agents, that if the body cannot be
said actually to enter into a state of putrefaction, it
may at least assume appearances so analogous as to
be mistaken for it. The test of death, therefore,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>must rather be sought for amongst those signs which
indicate the quiescence, or cessation of the functions
of life, than from those which manifest the decomposition
of the organs by which they are performed; and
here again it may be imagined that no difficulty or
fallacy can occur; the total cessation of respiration,
pulsation, sensation, and all motion, it might be supposed,
would indicate to the least experienced the departure
of life, while the general aspect of the body,
its pale and livid hue, the coldness of its surface, and
the stiffness of its limbs, we might conclude were
signs so palpable and satisfactory as to defy the possibility
of doubt. To the skilful medical practitioner
we apprehend such signs must ever be unequivocal;
but we are not prepared to say that a common observer
may not be sometimes deceived by them; in
cases of extreme debility, as in the latter stage of
fever, and where the patient is confined in vitiated
air, the exhaustion may be so considerable as to lend
all the appearance of death; indeed that such cases
have occurred we have no less a testimony than that
of the philanthropic <i>Howard</i>, who, in his work on
Prisons, says, “I have known instances where persons
supposed to be dead of the gaol fever, and
brought out for burial, on being washed with cold
water, have shewn signs of life, and soon afterwards
recovered.” <i>Hippocrates</i>, in his Epidemics, also
mentions the case of a woman who, being in appearance
dead, from fever, was recovered by throwing
thirty amphoræ of cold water over her body. <i>Diemerbroeck</i><a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c011'><sup>[3]</sup></a>
relates the case of a rustic who having appeared
to die of the plague, discovered after three
days no signs of respiration, but, on being carried
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>to the grave, recovered and lived many years afterwards;
and <i>Paul Zacchias</i> relates an analagous case
which occurred at the hospital of <i>Santo Spirito</i> at
Rome. At a period when the small-pox raged with
such epidemic fury, and physicians so greatly aggravated
its violence by their stimulating plan of cure,
there can be no doubt but that many persons were
condemned as dead who afterwards recovered;
amongst the numerous cases that might be cited in
support of this opinion, the following may be considered
as well authenticated: the daughter of <i>Henry
Laurens</i>, the first President of the American congress,
when an infant, was laid out as dead, in the
small-pox; upon which the window of the apartment,
that had been carefully closed during the progress
of the disease, was thrown open to ventilate the
chamber, when the fresh air revived the supposed
corpse, and restored her to her family; this circumstance
occasioned in the father so powerful a dread
of living interment, that he directed by will that
his body should be burnt, and enjoined on his children
the performance of this wish as a sacred duty.</p>

<p class='c000'>We can also imagine, that women, after the exhaustion
consequent on severe and protracted labours,
may lie for some time in a state so like that of death,
as to deceive the by-standers; a very extraordinary
case of this kind is related in the <cite>Journal des Sçavans</cite>,
Janvier 1749.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Dr. Gordon Smith</i>, in his work on Forensic Medicine,
has observed that in cases of precipitancy or
confusion, as in times of public sickness, the living
have not unfrequently been mingled with the dead,
and that in warm climates, where speedy interment is
more necessary than in temperate and cold countries,
persons have even been entombed alive; we feel no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>hesitation in believing that such an event may be possible;
but the very case with which the author illustrates
his position is sufficient to convince us that its
occurrence would be highly culpable, and could only
arise from the most unpardonable inattention; “I
was” says <i>Dr. Smith</i>, “an eye witness of an instance
in a celebrated city on the continent, where a poor
woman, yet alive, was solemnly ushered to the margin
of the grave in broad day, and whose interment
would have deliberately taken place, but for the interposition
of the by-standers;” if the casual observer
was thus able to detect the signs of animation, the
case is hardly one that should have been adduced to
shew the difficulty of deciding between real and apparent
death. Many other illustrations might be adduced,
but it is not our intention to amuse the reader
with a relation of those numerous <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">nugæ canoræ</span></i> that
enliven several popular productions on the subject of
<em>trances</em>, premature interments, and extraordinary resuscitations;
the public have always betrayed a morbid
curiosity upon the subject, and the stories of persons
buried alive have ever found a ready access to
our credulity, as well as to our compassion.</p>

<p class='c000'>Amongst the different anecdotes which have been
brought forward in support of the popular belief in
the frequency of living interment, and in proof of
the fallacy of those signs which are commonly received
as the unerring indications of death, we read
of numerous instances where the knife of the anatomist
has proved the means of <a id='res'></a>resuscitating the supposed
corpse; <i>Philippe Peu</i>, the celebrated French
accoucheur, relates, himself, the case of a woman,
upon whose supposed corpse he proceeded to perform
the cæsarean section, when the first incision betrayed
the awful fallacy under which he operated;
the history of the unfortunate <i>Vesalius</i>, physician to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>Philip II. of Spain, furnishes another instance, upon
which considerable stress has been laid; upon dissecting
a Spanish gentleman, it is said that on opening
the thorax the heart was found palpitating; for
which he was brought before the inquisition, and
would probably have suffered its most severe judgment,
had not the king interceded in his behalf, and
obtained for him the privilege of expiating his offence
by a pilgrimage to the Holy Land.<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c011'><sup>[4]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'><i>M. Bruhier</i><a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c011'><sup>[5]</sup></a> also relates a case on the authority
of <i>M. l’Abbé Menon</i>, of a young woman who was restored
by the first incision of the anatomist’s scalpel,
and lived many years afterwards. With respect to
the instance of <i>Vesalius</i> we would make this general
observation, which will probably apply to most of
the cases on record; that the movements which have
been observed on such occasions are not to be received
as demonstrations of life, they merely arise from a
degree of muscular irritability which often lingers for
many hours after dissolution, and which, on its apparent
cessation, may be even re-excited by the application
of galvanic stimuli.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>But there is a propensity in the human mind to believe
in these horrors, because between credulity and
fear there is an inherent affinity and alliance; and it
may be very safely asserted, that there is nothing
of which we have a greater instinctive horror,<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c011'><sup>[6]</sup></a> than
of any force by which our voluntary exertions are
totally repressed; hence it is, as <i>Cuvier</i> has remarked,
that the poetic fictions best calculated to insure our
sympathy, are those which represent sentient beings
inclosed within immoveable bodies; the sighs of Clorinda
issuing, with her blood, from the trunk of the
cypress, as related in the fable of Tasso, would arrest
the fury of the most savage mortal; and the
sufferings which attended the confinement of Ariel,
by the witch <i>Sycorax</i>, within the rift of a cloven
pine, are described by Prospero as being of so pitiable
a description as to move the sympathy of the very
beasts of the forest.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>The author of the present chapter had once an opportunity
of witnessing a most striking manifestation
of the popular feeling to which he has just alluded;
a sailor, who had died suddenly on board a vessel in
Mount’s Bay, was sent on shore for interment on
the same evening: this indecent haste in consigning
the yet warm corpse of a human being to the grave,
excited a very strong and natural feeling in those to
whom the fact was communicated; in a few hours the
knowledge of the circumstance became general in the
town of Penzance, and imagination which, in cases
that interest the feelings, is always ready to colour
each feature with the hue most congenial to the fancy,
soon represented the case as one of living interment,
and by midnight the impression had produced so
strong an effect upon the credulity of the town, that
many hundred persons assembled at the house of the
mayor and insisted upon the disinterment of the
body; the author, in his professional capacity, was
called upon to accompany the magistrates in the investigation,
which was accomplished by torch light,
amidst an immense concourse of people; the body
was disinterred, when, it is almost needless to add,
that not the slightest mark was observed that could
in the least sanction the popular belief so readily
adopted, and enthusiastically maintained.</p>

<p class='c000'>Within the last few years a singular and unphilosophical
work<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c011'><sup>[7]</sup></a> has appeared from the pen of a learned
divine, which is well calculated to cherish the public
credulity upon the subject under discussion, and to
excite many groundless alarms, as well as unjust expectations,
respecting the possibility of latent life; the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>reverend author, it must be confessed, has furnished
a practical proof of his talents in his favourite art of
resuscitation, by recalling into life the numerous idle
tales, and superstitious histories, that we had hoped
had long since been for ever consigned to the “tombs
of all the Capulets.” The histories of persons having
been buried alive, or recovered after apparent death,
are not, however, confined to the annals of modern
times; we are informed by <i>Diogenes Laertius</i> that
<i>Empedocles</i> acquired great fame for restoring a woman,
supposed to be dead, from a paroxysm of hysteria;
and <i>Pliny</i>, in his Natural History, devotes
a chapter to the subject, under the title of “<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">De his qui
elati revixerunt</span></i><a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c011'><sup>[8]</sup></a>;” in which an interesting case is related
of <i>Avicola</i>, whose body was brought out and
placed on the funeral pile, the flames of which are
said to have resuscitated the unhappy victim, but too
late to allow it to be rescued from its powers; but
such cases merely go to shew that the common observer
may be deceived. We feel no hesitation in
asserting that it is physiologically impossible for a
human being to remain more than a few minutes in
such a state of asphyxia, as not to betray some sign
by which a medical observer can at once recognise
the existence of vitality, for if the respiration be only
suspended for a short interval, we may conclude that
life has fled for ever; of all the acts of animal life
this is by far the most essential and indispensable;
<em>breath</em> and <em>life</em> are very properly considered in the

However slow and feeble respiration may
become by disease, yet it must always be perceptible,
provided the naked breast and belly be exposed; for
when the intercostal muscles act, the ribs are elevated,
and the sternum is pushed forward; when the
diaphragm acts, the abdomen swells; now this can
never escape the attentive eye, and by looking at
the chest and belly we shall form a safer conclusion
than by the popular methods which have been usually
adopted, such as the placing a vessel of water on the
thorax, in order to judge by the stillness or agitation
of the fluid; or holding the surface of a mirror before
the mouth, which, by condensing the aqueous vapour
of the breath, is supposed to denote the existence
of respiration, although too feeble to be recognised
in any other way.</p>

<p class='c000'>For the same purpose, light down, or any flocculent
substance, from the extreme facility with which
it is moved, has been supposed capable of furnishing
a similar indication; but the result must not be received
as an unequivocal proof, and accordingly
<i>Shakspeare</i>, with that knowledge and judgment which
so pre-eminently distinguish him, has represented

<p class='c000'>With respect to the above tests it may be remarked,
that an imperceptible current of air may agitate the
light down, and thus simulate the effects of respiration,
while an exhalation, totally unconnected with
that function, may sully the surface of a mirror held
before the mouth; on the other hand, we have learnt
from experience that mirrors have been applied to
persons in a state of mere syncope without being in
the least tarnished.</p>

<p class='c000'>Having thus considered the value of the tests of
respiration, we shall proceed to appreciate those
which have been considered as furnishing no less certain
indications of death. The absence of the circulation,
the impossibility of feeling the pulsations of
the heart and arteries have been regarded as infallible
means of deciding whether the individual be dead; but
it is proved beyond all doubt that a person may live
for several hours without its being possible to perceive
the slightest movement in the parts just mentioned.
It has been thought also, says <i>Orfila</i>, that
an individual was dead when he was cold, and that he
still lived if the warmth of the body was preserved;
there is perhaps no sign of so little value; the
drowned who may be recalled to life, are usually very
cold; whilst in cases of apoplexy, and some other fatal
diseases, a certain degree of warmth is preserved
even for a long period after death. Stiffness of the
body is another sign of death upon which great reliance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>has been placed; but as it sometimes happens
that it exists during life, it becomes necessary to
point out the difference between the stiffness of death,
and that which occurs during life, in certain diseases.
For the following observations upon this subject
we acknowledge ourselves indebted to the judicious
treatise of <i>Orfila</i>.</p>

<p class='c012'>1. Stiffness may be very considerable in a person
who has been frozen, who is not yet dead, and
who may even be recalled to life. This stiffness
cannot be confounded with that which is the
inevitable result of death, because it is known
that the body has been exposed to the action
of severe cold, and above all because it is very
general; in fact, the skin, breasts, the belly,
and all the organs may possess the same rigidity
as the muscles, a circumstance not observable
in <em>cadaverous</em> stiffness, in which the muscles
alone present any degree of resistance; besides,
when the skin of a frozen person is depressed,
by pressing forcibly upon it with the finger, a
hollow is produced which is a long time in disappearing.
When the position of a frozen
limb is changed, a little noise is heard, caused
by the rupture of particles of ice contained in
the displaced part.</p>
<p class='c012'>2. The stiffness to which the late <i>M. Nysten</i> has
given the name of <em>convulsive</em>, and which sometimes
manifests itself in violent nervous diseases,
may be easily distinguished from <em>cadaverous</em>
stiffness; when a limb is stiff in consequence
of convulsions, &amp;c. the greatest difficulty
is experienced in changing its direction,
and when left, it immediately resumes its former
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>position; it is not the same in stiffness from
death; the limb, the direction of which has
been changed, does not return to its former
position.</p>
<p class='c012'>3. The stiffness which occurs in certain forms of
<i>Syncope</i>, can never be confounded with <em>cadaverous</em>
stiffness; for, in the former case, the
stiffness takes place immediately after the commencement
of the disease, and the trunk preserves
a degree of warmth; whereas the <a id='cad'></a><em>cadaverous</em>
stiffness is not observed until some time
after death, and when the heat of the body is
no longer evident to the senses.</p>

<p class='c000'>If, from a cause which it is not always possible to
foresee, the individual who has been thought dead
for a long time be cold and <em>flexible</em>, instead of offering
a certain degree of stiffness, and at the same time
if no evidence of putrefaction has as yet displayed itself,
the body ought not to be buried hastily—“<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Satius
est adhiberi millies nimiam diligentiam, quam semel
omitti necessariam.</span></i>”</p>

<p class='c000'>The cadaverous state of the face, of which <i>Hippocrates</i>
has given the following description, has been
regarded as a sign of real death; the forehead
wrinkled and dry, the eye sunken, the nose pointed,
and bordered with a violet or black circle, the temples
sunken, hollow, and retired, the ears sticking
up, the lips hanging down, the cheeks sunken, the
chin wrinkled and hard, the colour of the skin leaden
or violet, the hairs of the nose and eye-lashes sprinkled
with a kind of yellowish white dust. It must be admitted
that such signs, if taken separately, are of no
value, since they are sometimes observed in patients
twenty-four or forty-eight hours before death; while,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>on the other hand, they are often absent in cases of
sudden dissolution. The softness, dimness, and above
all, the flaccidity of the globe of the eye have been
considered as very unequivocal in their indication.
<i>Professor Louis</i><a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c011'><sup>[10]</sup></a> has offered some remarks upon
this subject worthy our notice; he says that, in the
dead, the transparent cornea is commonly covered
with a thin slimy membrane, which breaks in pieces
when touched, and is easily removed by wiping the
cornea; but he remarks that some appearance of it
takes place in the eyes of the dying, and also allows
that it may be the result of disease; so much for the
value of this sign: the one which follows appears to
us less exceptionable; in a few hours after death,
adds this author, the eyes become soft and flabby, an
effect not to be produced under any circumstances in
the living body; we join in this opinion; but how
often does it happen that the globe of the eye undergoes
no alteration in form, until the putrefactive
process has been fully established?</p>

  <h2 id='c5' class='c008'>OF THE PHYSIOLOGICAL CAUSES, AND PHŒNOMENA OF SUDDEN DEATH.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>It has been asserted by <i>Bichat</i><a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c011'><sup>[11]</sup></a> that the immediate
cause of death, when it takes place suddenly,
must be the cessation of the functions of the heart,
brain, or lungs; although it is sometimes difficult to
determine which of these organs is the first to fail in
its action; this may be well exemplified by the poisonous
operation of Arsenic upon the animal economy,
which when introduced into the circulating
system will, according to the valuable experiments
of <i>Mr. Brodie</i>, occasion stupor and paralysis, a feeble
and intermitting contraction of the heart, and slow
and laborious respiration; but it is found that in
some cases, one order of symptoms will predominate,
and be the first to display themselves, whilst in
others, the very contrary will obtain, without perhaps
our being able to assign the immediate cause of
such deviations. There are, moreover, cases of sudden
death, in which the principle of animation would
seem to be at once annihilated in every part of the
animal machine, and when every organ appears to be
simultaneously affected, as in that occasioned by the
agency of intense cold, and sometimes, for it is not
in every instance, by that of lightning, or electricity;
still, as a general proposition, the aphorism of
<i>Bichat</i> must be admitted; and we shall proceed to investigate
the subject of sudden death, as connected
with medico-judicial inquiry, upon principles deduced
from the enlightened views of this distinguished
philosopher. To the able and satisfactory researches
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>of our English physiologist, <i>Mr. Brodie</i>, we are also
greatly indebted for a correct notion of the nature
and order of succession, of those events by which life
is quickly extinguished; his attention was many years
ago directed to one important branch of this subject,—to
the investigation of that series of changes produced
on living bodies by the operation of poisons, the results
of which were published in the <cite>Philosophical
Transactions</cite>,<a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c011'><sup>[12]</sup></a> to which we shall have frequent occasion
to refer in the following pages. Since that period
he has diligently pursued the subject in its more
extensive ramifications, and in his lectures, delivered
from the anatomical chair of the College of Surgeons
during the last year, he presented a condensed and
philosophical history of the phenomena of death, in
general, in which he elucidated many leading points
that were before obscure, established several propositions
that have long been considered doubtful, and
rejected a mass of popular error, which, under the
sanction of authority, has continued to retard our inquiries,
and to embarrass and misguide our practice.
The author of the present section of this work has to
acknowledge the kindness and liberality by which he
is enabled to avail himself of these luminous researches,
having been furnished by his friend <i>Mr.
Brodie</i> with the manuscript notes from which the
lectures were delivered.</p>

<p class='c000'>The organs more immediately necessary to life are,
the <span class='sc'>Heart</span>, which conveys to every part of the body
that fluid, without a constant supply and change of
which, vitality must be speedily exhausted; and the
<span class='sc'>Lungs</span>, by whose functions this essential fluid undergoes
those unknown changes, from the action of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>atmosphere, which adapt it for the performance of
the important duties to which we have alluded.</p>

<p class='c000'>In conformity with these views, the functions of
the heart, and their connection with those of the
lungs and brain, very naturally present themselves as
the first objects of physiological inquiry; and there
is certainly no discovery in modern times more interesting
in its relations, and at the same time so
useful in practical application, as that which has determined
the nature of the connections between the
functions of respiration and the motions of the heart;
and shewn why the cessation of the former should
occasion the destruction of the latter. The existence
of this mysterious connection constituted a subject of
interest and inquiry in the more remote ages, and it
will not be unprofitable to take a review of the different
theories which have been proposed for its explanation.
Until the celebrated experiment<a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c011'><sup>[13]</sup></a> of <i>Hook</i>,
it was supposed that the heart’s motion was maintained
by the alternate contraction and dilatation of
the lungs in the act of breathing; but the extraordinary
philosopher above mentioned decided this point
by exposing the thorax of a dog, and separating the
pleura extensively from the external surface of the
lungs, and then, by means of a pair of double bellows,
keeping up a constant stream of air through the air
cells; by this contrivance respiration was duly performed,
while the lungs remained motionless, and
yet it was found that the vigour of the heart’s action
was not in the least impaired; whereas, if the theory
which <i>Hook</i> undertook to refute, had been founded
in truth, the heart, under such circumstances, must
necessarily have become quiescent. <i>Mr. Hunter</i><a id='r14' /><a href='#f14' class='c011'><sup>[14]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>supposed the existence of a sympathy, or association,
between the motions of the heart and lungs; and the
same opinion appears to have been entertained by
<i>Dr. Currie</i><a id='r15' /><a href='#f15' class='c011'><sup>[15]</sup></a>; <i>Dr. Darwin</i><a id='r16' /><a href='#f16' class='c011'><sup>[16]</sup></a> deduced the existence
of this immediate connection from that general
law of the animal œconomy, by which motions that
are frequently repeated in succession acquire the
power of recurring in the same order, independently
of the original exciting cause; “it is thus,” says he,
“that by the stimulus of the blood in the right
chamber of the heart the lungs are induced to expand
themselves.” <i>Dr. Bostock</i><a id='r17' /><a href='#f17' class='c011'><sup>[17]</sup></a>, however, has very
satisfactorily opposed this hypothesis, by observing
that in the fœtus the heart commences its contractions
immediately upon its formation, while the lungs
remain perfectly at rest; and that when the animal
leaves the uterus, the motion of the lungs commences,
but the periods of the contraction of the diaphragm
bear no determinate ratio to those of the
systole of the heart.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was long supposed that the cessation of respiration
occasioned that of the heart’s motion, in consequence
of the black blood not having sufficient power
to stimulate its fibres; but does not the right side of
the heart, which, under all circumstances, contains
de-oxygenated blood, contract with a vigour equal
to that of the left? It was reserved for <i>Bichat</i> to
offer a true explanation of this phenomenon; he has
very justly stated that, in consequence of the suspension
of the respiratory function, the coronary vessels,
by which the muscular structure of the heart is supplied,
are compelled to carry black, instead of scarlet
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>blood; a fact which in itself is quite adequate to
explain the cause of the heart ceasing to contract; for
the irritability of this, like that of every other muscle,
can be alone maintained by duly oxygenized blood.
But it remains to be shewn how the functions of the
brain and nervous system stand related to those of
the heart and lungs. Although the agency of nervous
influence is necessarily involved in impenetrable obscurity,
yet we shall not have much difficulty in proving,
that <em>the brain</em><a id='r18' /><a href='#f18' class='c011'><sup>[18]</sup></a> <em>is immediately necessary to life
only because the muscles of respiration owe their action
to its influence</em>. <i>M. Lallemand</i> has published the
history of a fœtus, in which the brain and spinal marrow
were equally deficient, notwithstanding which,
it even exceeded the usual size, the heart was perfect,
and it was evident that the circulation had been
properly performed; no sooner, however, was the
monster born than it perished, because the diaphragm
and other muscles of respiration were unable to perform
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>their functions without the aid of nervous excitement;
no air was therefore inhaled into the lungs,
and in a few minutes the heart ceased to contract from
the deficient supply of oxygenized blood. If the phrenic
nerves of a quadruped be divided,<a id='r19' /><a href='#f19' class='c011'><sup>[19]</sup></a> the motion
of the diaphragm ceases, and the animal breathes by
the motion of the ribs alone, panting and respiring
with difficulty and distress. If the spinal marrow be
divided below the origin of the phrenic nerves in the
lower part of the neck, no interruption is given to
the transmission of the nervous influence to the diaphragm,
but the ribs now become motionless, and
respiration is performed by the diaphragm only; if
the spinal marrow be divided in the upper part of the
neck, above the origin of the phrenic nerves, the
nervous influence is neither transmitted to the diaphragm,
nor to the muscles which produce the motion
of the ribs, and respiration is entirely suspended;
under these circumstances the heart continues to
contract for some minutes, after which it ceases, as
there is no supply of blood which has received the influence
of the air, and, consequently, the muscular
fibres of the heart lose their excitability, and the
blood is no longer circulated; if, however, the lungs
be artificially inflated, before the action of the heart
has ceased, its motions are continued. The experiment
may also be very satisfactorily varied in the following
manner; apply a ligature to the carotid arteries
in the neck, so as to prevent the occurrence of
hemorrhage, and then decapitate the animal; if respiration
be now artificially maintained, the heart
will suffer no disturbance in its motions, but the circulation
will be preserved for several hours in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>body of the decapitated animal. In further illustration
of this view of the subject, <i>Mr. Brodie</i> observes,
that many reptiles which are capable of respiring by
means of the skin, will survive the loss of the brain
for so long a period, that the wound made by decapitation,
becomes cicatrized, and death only takes place
at last in consequence of inanition.—(<cite>Manuscript
Notes.</cite>)</p>

<p class='c000'>In farther illustration of these views, let us observe
the mode in which death takes place in apoplexy, or
in cases of pressure on the brain, whether occasioned
by a depressed portion of bone, or by blood extravasated
within the cranium. At first the patient is insensible
to all external impressions, but the breathing
is not affected; after an interval, however, the respiration
becomes difficult and laborious, and the purple
hue of the lips and cheeks, from the sub-cutaneous
vessels, demonstrates that the blood is imperfectly
oxygenized. The arterial action becomes more slow,
in proportion only as the respiration is more difficult;
and the pulse may even be distinguished at the
wrist, after the breathing has altogether ceased; under
such circumstances it is obvious that life might be
protracted for several hours by artificial inflation of
the lungs, but as no ultimate benefit could be derived
from such an operation, its expediency may be
fairly questioned.</p>

<p class='c000'>Enough has been said to shew that the brain is not
<em>immediately</em> necessary to the action of the heart; but
<i>Mr. Brodie</i> has very justly observed that the general
proposition thus established, must not lead us to the
conclusion that the heart is therefore incapable of
being affected by violent impressions on the nervous
system; the fact is quite otherwise, for although the
brain may be removed, and the circulation be nevertheless
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>maintained by artificial respiration, yet an injury
inflicted on the brain, of another kind, may be
followed by those immediately fatal consequences
which decapitation itself would not produce. <i>Dr.
Wilson Philip</i> states that if the brain be violently
crushed, the action of the heart is immediately
stopped; and the fact is too notorious to be questioned,
that a blow on the head is frequently succeeded
by Syncope; there are but few circumstances,
says <i>Mr. Brodie</i>, in the history of the animal œconomy
which appears more remarkable than this fact,
that <em>an injury of a part which is not immediately essential
to the heart’s action, should nevertheless, under certain
circumstances, have the effect of occasioning its
immediate cessation</em>. The late researches of <i>Le Gallois</i>
may perhaps receive farther elucidation from the
above proposition; this physiologist has stated that
if a wire be introduced into the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Theca vertebralis</span></i>, and
be moved upward and downward, so as to destroy
the texture of the spinal marrow, the action of the
heart presently ceases; and he from thence advances
to the conclusion, not only that the spinal marrow is
necessary to the heart’s action, but that every part of
the animal body derives its vital properties from it;
from what I have observed, says <i>Mr. Brodie</i> (<cite>Manuscript
Notes</cite>) in the repetition of the foregoing experiment,
I should infer that the fact is correctly
stated, as far as it relates to warm-blooded animals,
but the conclusions are undoubtedly premature; and
the history of the fœtus, as related by <i>Lallemand</i>, in
which, notwithstanding the absence of the brain and
spinal marrow, the child was even larger than usual,
the heart perfect, and it was manifest that the circution
had been duly performed, is in direct opposition
to such a theory. We must here agree with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span><i>Mr. Brodie</i>, that such phenomena are quite incompatible
with the doctrine in which the spinal marrow
is supposed to be directly necessary to the existence
of vitality in the system generally, and to the
action of the heart in particular; and that we must
therefore look for some other explanation of the
effects which are produced by the destruction of the
spinal marrow in warm-blooded quadrupeds.—May
they not be explained by supposing them to be the
effect of the shock which must necessarily attend the
removal of the spinal marrow, which can never be
effected with the facility that attends decapitation?</p>

<p class='c000'>We have deemed it necessary to offer these few remarks
upon the relations which subsist between the
functions of the heart, lungs, and brain, in as much
as the propositions which have been thus established
respecting them, can alone lead to a correct pathology
of those diseases, by which life is suddenly extinguished,
or suggest a rational and effectual plan
of treatment, in cases of <a id='sus'></a>suspended animation.</p>

  <h2 id='c6' class='c008'>SYNCOPE:<br /> <br />In which the pulsations of the heart cease, before the action of the respiratory organs.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The heart may cease to beat either from organic
lesions in its own structure, or in that of its vessels;
or from being sympathetically affected by injuries in
other parts<a id='r20' /><a href='#f20' class='c011'><sup>[20]</sup></a>; or from the operation of certain poisons;
or from a shock of the general nervous system,
as experienced in paroxysms of certain passions.</p>

<p class='c000'>In ordinary fainting it is evident that some slight
and feeble motions of the heart still continue, although
insufficient to produce a sensible pulsation in
the more distant arteries; and where this has continued
for an unusual period, and the respiration has
been so obscure as to escape common observation,
the phenomenon has been eagerly seized by the admirers
of the marvellous, and credulity has attached
to its history, under the name of <em>Trance</em>,<a id='r21' /><a href='#f21' class='c011'><sup>[21]</sup></a> circumstances
of extravagance and mystery, to which it
can hardly be necessary to allude on the present occasion.
But the motions of the heart may have ceased
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>altogether, and in such cases it <a id='bec'></a>becomes a question,
no less interesting to the practical physician than to
the physiologist, whether they can ever be restored,
and if so, we have to inquire under what limitation,
as to time; under what circumstances; and by what
means? The views which have been already offered
respecting the pathology of Syncope will afford us
considerable assistance in the solution of a problem,
so intimately connected with inquiries of forensic importance.
It would appear that where the heart has
ceased to pulsate, <em>in consequence of the cessation of
respiration, it can never again be set in motion</em>; but
that where it has stopped from other causes, as from
the operation of certain poisons, its muscular irritability
not having been exhausted, its action may be
occasionally revived. Where Syncope arises from
hemorrhage, we shall find, on dissection, that the
heart and its great vessels are either empty, or contain
only a small quantity of blood in their cavities;
but where Syncope arises from other causes, the heart
is seen distended to an unusual magnitude, and the
blood in the left auricle and ventricle is generally
of a more or less florid colour, and has not the hue
of venous blood; a circumstance which depends upon
the pulsation of the heart ceasing before the function
of respiration, and which is the very reverse of what
happens in death from suffocation, as we shall hereafter
explain.</p>

<p class='c000'>Violent passions of the mind very commonly produce
syncope, which has in some instances terminated in
death; we are however inclined to believe that in
fatal cases of this nature the persons must have
laboured under some organic affection of the heart,
or its vessels; <i>Philip V.</i> died suddenly on being told
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>that the Spaniards had been defeated, and on opening
the body, his heart was found ruptured.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Dr. Tissot</i> relates also the case of the father of a
numerous family, who having lost his wife whom he
tenderly loved, was suddenly seized with laborious
respiration, and died at the end of two days; when
the lungs were found gorged with blood, and the
heart ruptured. Now in both these cases, it is
probable that the muscular structure of the heart had
been softened by previous disease.<a id='r22' /><a href='#f22' class='c011'><sup>[22]</sup></a> So in the case
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>of <i>Mr. John Hunter</i>, whose life was suddenly
extinguished by mental emotion, the valves of the
heart had been long in a state of disease, and so well
aware was he of the danger to which he was constantly
exposed, that he had for some time previous
to his death, been in the habit of retiring from all
those situations, in which his passions were likely to
be excited. It is said that the instances of death
from sudden joy are more numerous than those from
grief, probably because the effect of this latter passion
is rather to retard than to accelerate the circulation;
<i>Sophocles</i>, being desirous of proving that at an
advanced age he was in full possession of his intellectual
powers, composed a tragedy, was crowned,
and died through joy; the same fate befel <i>Philippides</i>
the comic writer; thus too the Lacedemonian <i>Chilon</i>
expired in the embrace of his son who had borne
away the prize at the Olympic games; and we read
of Roman women who died in the same manner,
upon seeing their sons return from the battles of
Thrasymene and Cannæ. On the other hand, we
might adduce much classical authority to shew that
death has frequently been the sudden effect of grief.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Montaigne</i> relates the case of a German, who after
having performed great feats of valour, was killed at
the <a id='sie'></a>siege of Osen; one of the general officers having
desired to see the corpse of so gallant a man, was
conducted to the body, when he instantly recognised
the features of his own son, and died on the spot.
The record of our own times will furnish us with an
instance in which an actor of celebrity suddenly
expired upon repeating a passage that contained a

pain and terror in producing sudden extinction of life,
relates the case of a middle aged criminal, who having
throughout evinced extreme weakness and depression,
expired in his way to the scaffold, and was stiff before
he arrived at the place of execution, which was about
seven miles distant.</p>

<p class='c000'>In such cases of sudden death, from the operation
of violent mental emotions, we apprehend that dissection
will frequently demonstrate the existence of
previous disease in some of the organs immediately
essential to life; and we shall hereafter have occasion
to refer to the influence of the passions in hastening
the fatal termination of a chronic disease; on the
present occasion we introduce the following extremely
interesting case, in confirmation of the position we
are endeavouring to maintain; the case was originally
published in the <cite>Transactions of the Physico-Medical
Society of New York, by Dr. Valentine Mott</cite>; it
afterwards appeared in the <cite>Journal Universel des
Sciences Medicales, Avril, 1819</cite>; and lately it has
found its way into the <cite>Medical Repository</cite> of this
country. A robust and plethoric female, aged 22,
long addicted to dissolute and intemperate habits,
had complained for some time of slight and apparently
rheumatic pains; but within a day or two of the
fatal event, she had been deserted by a man to whom
she was engaged in marriage; in consequence of
which her mind became very deeply affected; after
having supped on the preceding night, she retired to
rest as usual, and in the morning was found dead in
bed; she lay in a bent position on the left side; and
was hence supposed at first to be in a profound sleep;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>neither the countenance nor the limbs were in the
least distorted. On dissection the pericardium was
found to contain ten ounces of coagulated blood, and
two of serum; the heart on all sides being covered
by it, was of ordinary volume, but much loaded with
fat; at the summit of the aortic ventricle was discovered
the breach from which the effused blood had issued;
the parietes of the ventricle around the rupture were
much thicker than in the natural state, and on close
examination a very sensible fluctuation was distinguished,
to the extent of an inch on one side of it,
from which flocculi of a cheese-like substance were
discharged on pressure; the pericardium also presented
traces of inflammation.</p>

<p class='c000'>We have here then a case in which a morbid
change in the structure of the heart had existed for a
considerable period, and which was suddenly brought
to a fatal termination by an affection of the mind.</p>

<p class='c000'>Before we quit the consideration of <i>Syncope</i>, we
have to notice a fatal variety of that disease, which
well deserves the attentive consideration of the forensic
Physician, whose highest duty, let it be remembered,
is the investigation of sudden death. It
is described by <i>Mr. Chevalier</i><a id='r24' /><a href='#f24' class='c011'><sup>[24]</sup></a> under the term
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Asphyxia Idiopathica</span></i>, in which the patient suddenly
faints and dies; the essential circumstances of the
disease evidently denote, says <i>Mr. Chevalier</i>, a sudden
loss of power in the extreme vessels to propel
the blood; in consequence of which the heart after
having contracted, so as to empty itself, and then dilated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>again, continues relaxed for want of the return
of its accustomed stimulus, and dies in that dilated
state. On dissection all the cavities of the heart are
found completely empty, and the viscus itself in a
state of extreme flaccidity.</p>

  <h2 id='c7' class='c008'>SUFFOCATION.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Suffocation may be defined, the destruction of
life by the suspension of the function of respiration,
occasioned by external violence. Unless we add “<em>by
external violence</em>” we shall perceive that the definition
would be far too comprehensive; and the term <em>Suffocation</em>
would be made to embrace a much wider
range of subjects than its popular acceptation would
allow. If the physiological views be correct which
we have adopted and explained in the foregoing section,
“On the causes and phenomena of sudden
death,” we should be compelled, without such a protecting
adjunct, to include under the history of Suffocation,
not only the phenomena of Drowning,
Strangling, Hanging, Smothering, and noxious inhalation,
but even those of Apoplexy, fatal Intoxication,
and various diseases of the brain and spinal
marrow, together with the effects of a great proportion
of Poisons; for by such agents death is undoubtedly
occasioned through the failure of the respiratory
functions.</p>

<p class='c000'>In Death from Suffocation the heart continues to
pulsate for several minutes after the breathing has
entirely ceased, in consequence of which the blood
which passes through the pulmonary vessels no longer
receives the influence of oxygen, and therefore <em>black</em>
blood circulates; the brain, it would appear, soon
feels the want of the florid arterial stream, by which
alone its energies can be maintained. <i>Bichat</i> has
shewn that when dark coloured blood is injected into
the vessels of the brain, by means of a syringe connected
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>with the carotid artery, the functions of the
brain become immediately disturbed, and, in a short
time, entirely cease; the effect is precisely similar,
whether the dark coloured blood be transmitted to
the brain by the syringe of the experimentalist, or by
the heart itself. It is not until after the full effects
of the suspended respiration are thus produced on the
brain, that the motions of the heart become enfeebled,
and that the ventricles contract less powerfully,
and at longer intervals; at length, the action
of the heart is altogether arrested, and if the thorax
be examined at the instant that the circulation has
ceased, nothing is observed, except a slight tremulous
motion of the auricles; the cavities of the left
side are much contracted, and contain only a small
quantity of blood, while the right auricle and ventricle,
and the large vessels communicating with them,
are distended to an unusual size. This state of the
heart, it will be observed, is very different from that
which we have described as constantly occurring after
<i>Syncope</i>. In the contemplation of these phœnomena,
a question very naturally suggests itself in regard to
the probable interval which elapses between the cessation
of respiration, and the consequent failure of
the heart’s action; in other words, it may be asked,
how long can the heart support its contractions without
the aid of respiration? It would appear that this
interval not only varies in duration in different animals,
but even in the same animal under different
circumstances, such as that of age,<a id='r25' /><a href='#f25' class='c011'><sup>[25]</sup></a> capacity of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>thorax, quantity of air in the lungs, state of the
stomach, and general vigour of the animal; but in
man, under the most favourable circumstances, it is
extremely doubtful whether the heart ever continues
to pulsate for so long a period as five minutes<a id='r26' /><a href='#f26' class='c011'><sup>[26]</sup></a> after
the lungs have ceased to perform their office; and it
is very questionable whether, in most instances, the
interval is not considerably shorter than this.</p>

  <h3 class='c013'>BY DROWNING.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c014'>It was formerly believed that <i>Asphyxia</i><a id='r27' /><a href='#f27' class='c011'><sup>[27]</sup></a> from
<em>drowning</em>, always depended upon the lungs and intestinal
canal being filled with water;<a id='r28' /><a href='#f28' class='c011'><sup>[28]</sup></a> whereas it
is hardly necessary to observe that it alone depends
upon the blood, in consequence of the suspension of
breathing, ceasing to possess the qualities which are
essential to the preservation of life. <i>M. Gauteron</i>
immersed a dog for more than a quarter of an hour,
without inflicting the least injury, having previously
inserted a long tube in the trachea, which was kept
elevated during the experiment above the surface of
the water.</p>

<p class='c000'>If a small animal be immersed in water, contained
in a transparent glass vessel, the phenomena of drowning
are readily discernible; there is first a deep expiration,
by which bubbles of air are expelled from
the lungs; there is then an effort to inspire, but the
effort is ineffectual; there being no air which can be
received into the lungs, and a spasm of the muscles of
the glottis seems to forbid the admission of any considerable
quantity of water into the trachea. The
attempts to breathe are repeated several times, and
at each attempt at expiration a small proportion of
air is expelled from the mouth and nostrils, until the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>air-cells of the lungs are almost emptied;<a id='r29' /><a href='#f29' class='c011'><sup>[29]</sup></a> then
the animal becomes insensible; and convulsive action
of the voluntary muscles mark the instant when the
brain begins to suffer from the influx of the dark coloured
venous blood. After the cessation of these
convulsive actions, the animal becomes motionless,
and gives no sign of life; but if the hand be applied
to the thorax, the actions of the heart, gradually becoming
fainter and fainter, indicate that some remains
of vitality still linger in the system. Before the circulation
of the blood altogether ceases, the muscles
of respiration once more resume their actions, and ineffectual
efforts are made to breathe. It is a remarkable
circumstance that the diaphragm continues to
exert itself nearly as long as the heart itself, and that
the interval between the cessation of the motions of
the diaphragm and that of the motions of the heart,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>which is so short in animals that die by strangulation,
is still shorter in those who perish by drowning.<a id='r30' /><a href='#f30' class='c011'><sup>[30]</sup></a>
These phenomena follow each other in rapid succession,
and the whole scene is closed, and the living
animal is converted into a lifeless corpse, incapable
of recovery, in the brief space of a few moments,
(<cite>Brodie’s Manuscript Notes</cite>). If however the
animal be taken out of the water before the total extinction
of life, and the diaphragm contract afterwards,
so as to draw air into the lungs before the
action of the heart has ceased, the circulation is
maintained, and the animal continues to respire; he
will thus have escaped immediate death from suffocation;
but his life still remains in jeopardy, for
there is <a id='sec'></a>a second period of danger, and one at which
death may take place, when we are the least prepared
to expect it; for the dark coloured blood which has
been transmitted through the circulatory system, during
the suspension of respiration, would seem to
act like a narcotic poison upon the brain; no sooner
therefore does it enter that organ, but deleterious
effects are produced, the animal at first falls into a
state of stupor, the pupils of the eyes become dilated,
the respiration laborious, the muscles of the body
convulsed, and the animal dies, <em>poisoned by its own
blood</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'>The body of a person who has died from drowning
exhibits a physiognomy which it is important to notice.
The whole surface is distinguished by a remarkable
coldness and pallor; the eyes are half open, and
their pupils considerably dilated; the tongue is pushed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>forward to the internal edges of the lips, and
sometimes wounded; and the mouth and nostrils are
covered with foam. At other times, instead of a pallid
visage, we have one that is swelled, and bloated with
livid blood.</p>

<p class='c000'>Upon dissection we shall perceive the vessels of the
brain more or less gorged with blood;<a id='r31' /><a href='#f31' class='c011'><sup>[31]</sup></a> in the trachea
a watery and bloody froth will be found; the lungs
will appear expanded, full of frothy mucus, and,
generally, livid; the right cavities of the heart gorged
with blood, the left nearly empty; and it has been
sometimes noticed that the blood remains fluid<a id='r32' /><a href='#f32' class='c011'><sup>[32]</sup></a>,
and follows after every incision by the scalpel. The
stomach will generally be found to contain some
water. <i>Hebenstreit</i> also states, that since in the act
of drowning the person dies on an inspiration, the
diaphragm is necessarily found convex, or bent towards
the abdomen; this statement however is erroneous.</p>

<p class='c000'>Upon these appearances we have a few observations
to offer, especially as they have given origin to
some important questions; and first, with respect to
<em>the presence of water in the stomach and lungs</em>, than
which few indications, connected with the subject of
drowning, have given occasion to greater controversy.<a id='r33' /><a href='#f33' class='c011'><sup>[33]</sup></a>
For since it hath been observed that
water is rarely found in the stomach or lungs of a
person who has been submerged after death, it was
inferred that the presence of that fluid in these organs
necessarily proved that the individual must have been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>plunged into the water during life. As a general
proposition this may be admitted as correct, although
it is liable to certain exceptions with which the medical
jurist ought to be acquainted; we may, for instance,
suppose a case, in which the submerged person
may be so plunged at once under water, as to
have been suffocated without his previously coming to
the surface, and when <i>asphyxia</i> has taken place, the
powers of deglutition, on which the presence of water
in the stomach wholly depends, are at an end; or we
may suppose that the party in question faints from
terror; a remarkable instance of this kind is quoted
by <i>Foderè</i>,<a id='r34' /><a href='#f34' class='c011'><sup>[34]</sup></a> from <i>Plater</i>, of a young woman, who
having been condemned to be drowned for infanticide,
fainted at the moment she was plunged in the water,
and having remained for a quarter of an hour under
its surface, recovered after being drawn out.<a id='r35' /><a href='#f35' class='c011'><sup>[35]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>With respect to the presence of water in the bronchiæ
and lungs, we may observe that, in the violent
struggles of a drowning man, a certain portion of
water generally passes the epiglottis; and being immediately
mixed with the air and mucus of the trachea,
constitutes that frothy mucus, which we have
described as being so highly characteristic of this
species of violent death; although we are not to conclude
with <i>Larrey</i>, that it is the immediate cause of
dissolution in such cases. The quantity of water,
however, thus forced into the pulmonary structure,
is extremely small, for its entrance is powerfully opposed
by a spasm of the muscles of the glottis;<a id='r36' /><a href='#f36' class='c011'><sup>[36]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>were it to occur in any considerable quantity, and to
appear in its fluid state, instead of that of froth, the
influence would clearly be, that <em>it had passed in after
death</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'>Although the presence of this frothy matter must
be considered as a strong presumptive proof that the
person found in the water had perished by drowning,
the converse of this proposition is by no means established
by the absence of such an indication.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>The buoyancy of the human body</em> is another point
in the history of Drowning, which has occasioned
much discussion; and in solving the problem, so
highly important in its forensic relations, <em>whether a
body found in the water, had been drowned, or thrown
in after death</em>, it has been considered by some physiologists
as capable of affording a certain degree of presumptive
evidence, although we are inclined to attach
but little or no importance to such an indication. The
specific gravity of the human body, under ordinary
circumstances, is very little greater than that of fresh
water, so small indeed is the difference that, when
the lungs are inflated, a man will float<a id='r37' /><a href='#f37' class='c011'><sup>[37]</sup></a> with little
or no effort, if he have sufficient self possession, and
does not attempt to raise too great a portion of his
body out of the sustaining fluid;<a id='r38' /><a href='#f38' class='c011'><sup>[38]</sup></a> but, when the
air of the lungs is expelled, and probably, at the
same time, a certain quantity of water is taken into
the stomach,<a id='r39' /><a href='#f39' class='c011'><sup>[39]</sup></a> the body becomes specifically heavier,
and the victim sinks. It may be assumed as a general
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>rule, that no newly drowned body floats, although
many facts have been adduced in support of a contrary
opinion; the naval custom of loading the dead
bodies with weights, before they are consigned to a
watery grave, is not for the purpose of sinking the
corpse, but for preventing its rising after the process
of putrefaction has commenced. The period during
which a body will remain at the bottom cannot be
very accurately determined, as the change does not
take place until a sufficient <a id='qua'></a>quantity of air be generated
to buoy it again to the surface; in the melancholy
instance of the loss of the Royal George, the
dead bodies were observed ascending to the surface
of the sea, on or about the fifth day. The general
position of a body which has thus risen, provided
there be no external or adventitious circumstances
to change it, is such, that it floats nearly immersed,
the face, arms, and legs hanging downwards, and the
loins being uppermost; this is the form which the
body must mechanically and hydrostatically assume,
if the sustaining power of generated air be, as it generally
will, in the cavity of the abdomen, where
putrefaction is more likely to commence; for the head
and limbs are generally<a id='r40' /><a href='#f40' class='c011'><sup>[40]</sup></a> specifically heavier than
water, while the trunk, especially if inflated with air,
is somewhat lighter.</p>

<p class='c000'>It has been said that a position, different from that
which we have just described, will take place where
the person has been strangled, and the body then
thrown into the water; for in this latter case, it is
contended, that the lungs will be distended with air,
and that consequently, the sustaining power must be
in the thorax; in support of this opinion the story of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>the appearance of <i>Caraccioli</i><a id='r41' /><a href='#f41' class='c011'><sup>[41]</sup></a>, Admiral of the
Neapolitan navy, has been ingeniously adduced; this
unfortunate man was hanged in pursuance of the sentence
of a court martial, and his body was committed
to the deep in the usual manner; thirteen days after
which, while the King of Sicily was walking on the
deck of Lord <i>Nelson’s</i> ship, he suddenly exclaimed
with a yell of horror—“<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vien! Viene!</span></i>”—The Admiral’s
corpse, breast high, was seen floating towards the
ship; the shot that had been attached to the feet for
the purpose of sinking it, not being sufficiently heavy.
This may perhaps be explained by supposing that the
corpse was stiff before it was immersed, in which
case, the centre of gravity being exceedingly low on
account of the shot tied to the feet, he must have
floated upright, wherever the buoyant power from
generated air might be situated. At all events, we
feel no hesitation in at once rejecting the proposition,
for the support of which it has been brought
forward; the fact is that, in relation to gaseous contents,
the lungs are the same in strangled, as in
drowned persons; for in both cases a quantity of air
is forcibly expelled from them before dissolution.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>2. BY HANGING:</h3>

<p class='c014'>The suspension of a person by means of a cord, or
some other ligature, round the neck, by which death
is produced by closing the trachea, and preventing
respiration.</p>

<p class='c000'>Although we are in this case bound to admit that
the immediate cause of death is suffocation, yet we
cannot deny that other injuries are often produced by
hanging, such as</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>

      <div class='line'>1. <i>Pressure on the vessels.</i></div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>1. <i>Pressure on the Vessels.</i>—The red and livid
hue of the face of persons killed by hanging, very
naturally induced a belief that <i>Apoplexy</i><a id='r42' /><a href='#f42' class='c011'><sup>[42]</sup></a> was
the immediate cause of death; while it is evident
that the pressure on the jugular veins must necessarily
so prevent the return of blood to the heart,
as to produce an accumulation in the vessels of
the brain: <i>Dr. Hooper</i> has a preparation of the
brain of an executed criminal, in which blood is seen
extravasated among the membranes; and various
other cases have occurred, where dissection has
clearly demonstrated the existence of those vascular
congestions and sanguineous effusions, upon which
apoplexy is supposed to depend; but this merely
goes to prove that apoplexy occasionally takes place
from hanging; it does not establish the fact of its being
the common cause of death on such occasions.<a id='r43' /><a href='#f43' class='c011'><sup>[43]</sup></a> <i>Gregory</i>
made the following experiment to shew that it
is to the interception of air that death is to be attributed;
after having opened the trachea of a dog he
passed a slip knot round the neck, above the wound;
the animal, though hanged, continued to live and
respire, the air was alternately admitted and easily
expelled through the small opening; but as soon as
the constriction was made below the orifice, the animal
perished. <i>Mr. Brodie</i> hanged a dog, and as
soon as it became insensible, the trachea was opened
below the ligature, upon which he breathed, and his
sensibility returned.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>2. <i>Pressure on the Nerves of the Neck.</i> Although
the pressure of a ligature on the nerves of the neck
cannot be considered as the immediate cause of death
in hanging, yet <i>Mr. Brodie</i> has very justly observed,
that if the animal recovers of the direct consequence
of the strangulation, he may probably suffer from the
effects of the ligature upon the nerves afterwards.
<i>Mr. Brodie</i> passed a ligature under the trachea of a
Guinea pig, and tied it tight on the back of the neck
with a knot; the animal was uneasy, but nevertheless
breathed and moved about; at the end of fifteen
minutes the ligature was removed; on the following
morning, however, the animal was found dead. On
dissection no preternatural appearances were discovered
in the brain, but the lungs were dark and turgid
with blood, and presented an appearance similar
to that which is observed after the division of the
nerves of the eighth pair; I do not, observes <i>Mr.
Brodie</i> (<cite>Manuscript Notes</cite>) positively conclude from
this experiment that the animal died from an injury
inflicted upon the nerves of the eighth pair, but I
think that such a conclusion is highly probable; and
it becomes an object of inquiry whether a patient
having recovered from hanging, may not, in some instances,
die afterwards from the injury of the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">par
vagum</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>3. <i>Fracture of the Spine, and Dislocation of the
Neck.</i> The death of a hanged person may occasionally
take place by the luxation of the cervical vertebræ,
and the consequent injury of the spinal marrow;
this effect will be more likely to happen in
heavy persons, and where the culprit suffers on
a drop that precipitates him from a considerable
height. It is said that <i>Louis</i> discovered that of the
two executioners in Paris and Lyons, one dispatched
the criminal condemned to be hanged by luxating the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>head on the neck, whilst those who perished by the
hands of the other were completely strangled.</p>

<p class='c000'>An animal, when first suspended, is observed to
make repeated but ineffectual attempts to inspire;
violent convulsions of the whole body then ensue,
but which are not to be considered as the indications
of suffering, for they arise in consequence of the dark
coloured blood having reached the brain and spinal
marrow; and the animal at this period is necessarily insensible;
hanging does not occasion a painful death.<a id='r44' /><a href='#f44' class='c011'><sup>[44]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The lips, nose, and all those parts in which the hue
of the blood can be observed, exhibit a dark colour;
the countenance is distorted, the eyes protruded, and
frequently suffused with blood, the tongue is also
forced out of the mouth, and sometimes wounded,
although it has been observed that this phenomenon
will entirely depend upon the position of the rope,
for that when it presses above the thyroid gland the
tongue will be pushed back, in consequence of a compression
upon the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">os hyoides</span></i>, whereas if the pressure
be applied under the <i>cricoid</i> cartilage it will have the
effect of thrusting out the tongue. Blood is sometimes
discharged from the ears. It is not unusual for the
sufferer to void his urine, fæces, and even semen,
in <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">articulo mortis</span></i>. The fingers are usually bent, the
nails blue, and the hands nearly closed; and the
whole physiognomy exhibits a highly characteristic
appearance.</p>

same phenomena as those described under the history

water in the <i>bronchiæ</i>. With respect to the quantity
of air found in the lungs, much discrepancy of opinion
has existed. <i>Dr. Goodwyn</i>, in his experiments
on respiration, found that the lungs of a person who
had died from hanging, contained double the quantity
of gaseous contents of those who had died a natural
death. This result, however, is certainly not
correct; for there is always, as we have already
stated, a very forcible expulsion of air from the
lungs in the act of strangulation, and they are accordingly
found almost empty after death. <i>Mr.
Coleman</i> hanged an animal, and then secured the
<i>trachea</i> by a ligature, and removed the lungs; when,
upon receiving their gaseous contents in the hydro-pneumatic
apparatus, he found their quantity was
very far less than that which would have been collected
under other circumstances.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>3. BY MANUAL <a id='str'></a>STRANGULATION.</h3>

<p class='c014'>Whether strangulation be induced by the suspension
of the body by the neck, or by a ligature drawn
tight, or by any other pressure upon the trachea, the
physiological phenomena of death are the same;
where, however, the person has died from manual
strangulation, the marks about the neck will probably
be more evident, and the discolouration will correspond
with the marks of the fingers and nails; and we
may also expect to find traces of violence upon the
chest, for since the weight of the body is not obtained
in such a case, additional force becomes necessary to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>consummate the fatal act. On opening the bodies of
those who have been taken off by manual strangulation,
<i>Dr. Smith</i> thinks that the usual appearances of
this kind of death may not seem so conclusive as in
other cases: an opinion in which we feel inclined to
coincide; for in consequence of the greater resistance
of the sufferer, the functions of respiration and circulation
may continue in some measure for a longer period
than in drowning or hanging, which must be
considered as more summary processes of suffocation.
In the case of a woman who had been thus strangled
by two men, <i>Littre</i> found the tympanum of the left
ear lacerated, whence flowed about an ounce of blood;
the vessels of the brain were unusually turgid, red
blood was extravasated in the ventricles, as well as
at the base of the cranium; the lungs were distended
and their membrane vascular; not more, however,
than an ounce of blood was found in the right ventricle
of the heart, and it was fluid and frothy, like
that in the lungs; this circumstance deserves particular
notice, and can only be explained by supposing
that the respiration and circulation were not at once
arrested, but that the unhappy sufferer was enabled
to inhale air, at intervals, during the protracted
struggle<a id='r45' /><a href='#f45' class='c011'><sup>[45]</sup></a>; and yet in certain cases, death may be
very easily occasioned by manual strangulation, of
which the murder of <i>Dr. Clench</i>, in the year 1692,
may be adduced as an example; this gentleman was
strangled in a hackney coach by two men, while driving
about the streets of the city, without the coachman
having the slightest knowledge of the transaction,
until he afterwards found him quite dead,
kneeling down with his head on the seat, and a handkerchief
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>bound about his neck, in which was a piece
of coal, placed just over the windpipe.<a id='r46' /><a href='#f46' class='c011'><sup>[46]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c013'>4. BY SMOTHERING.</h3>

<p class='c014'>In this act the transit of the air into the lungs is
prevented by forcibly closing the nostrils and mouth.
It is very obvious that such a mode of destruction can
very rarely occur in an adult; for a comparatively
feeble resistance will be sufficient to overcome the
assailant in such an attempt. It may, however, occur
accidentally; it is not difficult to imagine that a
person, in a fit of intoxication, may be unable to extricate
himself from a position in which he might fall,
and in which respiration could not be performed. In
children this mode of suffocation is less rare, and it
may be either the result of design or accident, to
which we shall have occasion to refer, when treating
the subject of Infanticide.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>5. BY THE INHALATION OF AIR DEPRIVED OF OXYGEN.</h3>

<p class='c014'>There are many gases, the inspiration of which
occasions death; some of these act simply by excluding
oxygen, while others exert an absolutely deleterious
action in consequence of the specific powers
which they possess. It is exclusively to the first species
that our attention is at present to be directed;
the latter will constitute matter for future consideration,
under the title of <i>Aërial Poisons</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>It is a fact too well established to require any discussion,
that <em>oxygen</em> is the only principle which is
capable of producing the necessary changes in the
blood, during its transmission through the lungs;
and that, accordingly, whenever atmospheric air is
deprived of this principle, it is no longer capable of
supporting life, and the animal immersed in it instantly
dies. It is thus that death takes place from
exposure to the fumes of charcoal<a id='r47' /><a href='#f47' class='c011'><sup>[47]</sup></a>, to those of lime-kilns,
to the atmosphere of cellars, caverns, wells,
and dungeons.<a id='r48' /><a href='#f48' class='c011'><sup>[48]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The asphyxia from privies, drains, and common
sewers, depends upon a different cause, and will be
considered under the head of <em>Sulphuretted Hydrogen</em>,
in the history of poisons.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>The fatal effects of confined air in a small and
crowded room, were fully exemplified in the year
1742, when twenty persons were crammed in a part
of St. Martin’s round-house called the <em>hole</em>, during
the night, several of whom died; the surgeons on
that occasion gave it as their opinion, that when the
doors and windows were shut, the place could not
support twenty persons for three hours without danger
of their lives. A trial took place at the Old
Bailey in consequence; but we have not been more
successful than <i>Dr. Gordon Smith</i> in our search for
its report. The medical jurist would be called upon,
on such an occasion, for his opinion as to the nature
of the deteriorated air, the causes of its accumulation,
and whether it was adequate to the production of the
alleged effects; and possibly, whether the fatal consequences
might not have been averted by judicious
caution, or active exertion. The most awful exemplification
of the fatal effects of confined air is, however,
recorded in the interesting narrative of what
happened to the English in the <em>black hole</em> at Calcutta;
and which we shall briefly relate in this place; as it
involves some physiological phenomena to which we
shall hereafter have occasion to refer.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was in the month of June, 1756, that the Viceroy
of Bengal laid siege to Fort William, the English
factory at Calcutta. <i>Mr. Holwell</i>, assisted by the
factors and the garrison, defended this post with extreme
bravery; but was at length obliged to surrender.
There were at this time remaining in the
fort, an hundred and forty-five men and one woman.
The whole of this unfortunate company, many of
whom were wounded, and several very dangerously,
were shut up the same night in a small prison only
eighteen feet square. This prison, which is now
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>better known in England by the name of the <em>black
hole</em>, was enclosed by strong walls, and had only two
small windows at one end, secured by iron grates.
In this confined situation, which allowed only a space
of about eighteen square inches to each individual,
the heat and want of fresh air soon excited the most
horrible effects; the prisoners, in a state of despair,
began by attempting to force open the door, but in
this they were unsuccessful. Mr. <i>Holwell</i>, who was
placed near one of the windows, was more at his
ease than the rest, and was consequently more cool
and tranquil; and he recommended his companions
to be quiet and orderly, and not to exhaust their
strength by useless efforts. This advice produced
some little calm, interrupted, however, by the groans
of the wounded and the dying. The heat increased
every moment. Mr. <i>Holwell</i> recommended them
to strip off their cloaths, as a means of acquiring
more space; this was accordingly done, but with no
great relief; they attempted to improve this by fanning
the air with their hats, but even this was too
painful a task for men who were worn out by the
fatigue of the siege, and the heat of this dungeon.
Another of the company was for their kneeling down,
that they might have more air. They all readily
agreed to do this; and to rise together in order to
avoid confusion. This was done several times, but
every time the signal was given to rise, the number
of those who had strength enough to obey it diminished.
There were constantly some remaining on the
floor, who were unable to get up, and these were
trodden to death by the survivors. All this happened
during the first hour of their imprisonment.
At nine o’clock in the evening they began to complain
of excessive thirst, and to renew their efforts
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>to open the prison door, and to tempt the centinels to
fire upon them. Some of those who were farthest
from the window became at once furiously delirious.
The cry for water was unanimous. The guards
brought water, and <i>Holwell</i> and two of his wounded
friends received it at the window in their hats, and
were going to pass it on to the rest; but so eager and
tumultuous were the efforts of the crowd to get at this
water, that <i>Holwell’s</i> two friends were suffocated,
the water was spilt, and <i>Holwell</i> saw himself surrounded
with dead bodies, who had either been
crushed to death, or died for want of fresh air.</p>

<p class='c000'>Hitherto the commander and benefactor of these
unfortunate people, had been treated with some
degree of respect, but now all distinction began
to be forgotten; the whole company eagerly threw
themselves towards the windows, and seizing the
iron bars, some of them got even upon his shoulders.
He was so borne down by this enormous weight, as
to be deprived of all power of motion; he implored
the pity of those who were upon his head and his
shoulders, and requested them to let him go and die
at the bottom of the prison; this request was readily
complied with, every one was desirous of succeeding
to his place, and without much difficulty he reached
the farther end of the dungeon. The third part of
these unhappy people were already dead, and they
who were still alive pressed so eagerly towards the
windows, that <i>Holwell</i> found himself somewhat freer
in his new station; but the air was so corrupted, that
his breathing soon became extremely difficult and
painful. Unable therefore to support this, he attempted
once more to make his way to the windows;
and leaning on a heap of dead bodies, he now resolved
to wait patiently for death. In this situation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>he remained about ten minutes, and then he experienced
such a pain of the breast, and so violent a
palpitation of the heart, that he was obliged to make
one more attempt towards getting a less fatal air.
There were five rows of his companions between himself
and the window; his despair carried him through
four of these. The palpitation of his heart now began
to abate, but he felt inexpressible thirst, and
cried out for water; but the water seemed to increase
instead of alleviating his thirst; he therefore resolved
to drink no more, and rather chose to suck the moisture
from his shirt, which seemed to afford him some
relief. A young man quite naked, who stood before
him, eagerly seized the sleeve of his shirt, and for
some moments deprived him of this salutary refreshment.
It was not yet midnight. The small number
of those who were left, were transported to the greatest
excess of rage and despair. They all called
aloud for air, because the water that had been
brought to them afforded no relief. Soon after this
the noise suddenly ceased. The greater part who
were living laid themselves down, deprived of all
their strength, and peaceably breathed their last.
Others aimed at getting into <i>Holwell’s</i> situation; a
Dutchman mounted on one of his shoulders, and a
black soldier on the other. In this situation he
remained till two in the morning, when he gave up
his place to a marine officer, who was soon forced out
of it by the Dutchman. The officer retired with
<i>Holwell</i> to the other corner of the prison, and in a few
moments afterwards died. <i>Holwell</i> himself was soon
deprived of sense, and from that time till sun rise we
have no account of what passed. One of those who
remained alive, at five in the morning, drew forth
<i>Holwell</i> from the heap of dead, and found in him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>some signs of life; about that time the Viceroy inquired
whether he was still alive; he was told, that
if the door was immediately opened, it would, perhaps,
be possible to recover him, and orders were
accordingly given for this purpose. But the door of
the prison opened inwards, and they who were within
it, and living, were deprived of all their strength, so
that more than twenty minutes elapsed before the
dead bodies were removed, which prevented the door
from being opened.</p>

<p class='c000'>At a quarter after six o’clock, there came out of
this melancholy dungeon three and twenty persons,
the remains of the hundred and forty-six who had
entered it on the preceding evening.</p>

<p class='c000'>Upon the events thus related we have to remark,
that no advice could be more judicious than that
given by <i>Holwell</i> to his companions in the early
part of their imprisonment—“to be quiet and
orderly, and not to exhaust their strength by useless
efforts.” Nor can we imagine any measure
more calculated to increase the sufferings of their
situation than that which was subsequently proposed,
and adopted, by another of the company, “to fan
the air with their hats, and to kneel down and rise
together, by a simultaneous motion.” It has been
satisfactorily established by physiological researches,
that the demand for oxygen, in an animal body, will
be in proportion to its expenditure by muscular
exertions.<a id='r49' /><a href='#f49' class='c011'><sup>[49]</sup></a> Whenever, therefore, circumstances
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>may render a supply of air deficient, we shall best
economise that which we possess by perfect quiet.
<i>Lavoisier</i> says, that a man, under ordinary circumstances,
consumes 1300 or 1400 cubic inches of oxygen
in an hour, but he found that if he is engaged
in raising weights the consumption is at the rate of
3200 in the hour.</p>

<p class='c000'>Infants appear to be less able to sustain the deprivation
of oxygen than adults; and in some cases on
record, life has been destroyed by circumstances that
we should have <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">a priori</span></i> considered as hardly adequate
to such an effect. A case is related of a child, who
was suffocated by some drunken men having repeatedly
blown out a candle, and held the smoaking wick
under its nose. The faculty of Leipsic investigated
the circumstances, and declared the death to have
taken place in consequence of suffocation. (<cite>Valentini
Pand: Med: Legal: Sect: 2.</cite>)</p>

<h3 class='c013'>6. BY OTHER MODES, NOT INCLUDED IN THE FOREGOING SECTIONS.</h3>

<p class='c014'>We have already stated that if the muscles of respiration
be paralysed, the animal can no longer breathe;
and it dies in a state of suffocation. There are several
mechanical modes by which such a condition may be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>produced; a person buried in a heap of ruins, although
his head should be free, will perish from the
pressure of the surrounding rubbish preventing the
due action of the respiratory muscles. It was in this
way that criminals who obstinately refused to plead,
often died under the pressure of the weights that
were heaped upon their bodies.<a id='r50' /><a href='#f50' class='c011'><sup>[50]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c000'>There is a mode of suffocation, described by <i>Galen</i>,
as being practised by the slaves when brought into
the presence of the judges or executioners; it consisted
in swallowing their tongue, by which it is said
they voluntarily terminated their own existence. Several
more modern authors have noticed this incredible
mode of suicide, as one that is resorted to by
negroes: now to confute such an idea, we have only
to shew the attachment of the muscles of this part,
and the motions which they permit; equally absurd
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>is it to suppose with other physiologists, that persons
can occasion suffocation by a voluntary suspension of
their breathing; for if such an attempt were even
made, the effort would be ended when self-possession
was once lost, for then the impulse of nature must
instantly triumph over any struggle to oppose it.
We are not, however, prepared to say that such an
attempt might not, in certain cases, occasion such a
cerebral congestion as to produce apoplexy.</p>

<p class='c000'>The last cause of suffocation which we have to
mention is mechanical obstruction, from the entrance
of foreign bodies into the aperture of the glottis;
instances of this kind are too numerous and familiar
to require many observations: it is thus that <i>Anacreon</i>
is said to have perished from a grape-seed; <i>Gilbert</i>,
the poet, terminated his existence in a similar manner;
he was a man of great appetite, and in the midst of a
festival went into a neighbouring room, but did not
return to the great surprise of his convivial companions.
He was found stretched on a couch without any
signs of life. The assistance administered by his kind
but uninformed friends was useless; on opening the
body a small piece of mutton was found, that had
stopped at the entrance of the larynx, and completely
prevented the passage of air into this organ. In Oct.
1821, two inquisitions were taken at Mildenhall, before
the Coroner of Bury St. Edmonds in Suffolk; in
the one case it appeared that <i>John Harris</i> had eaten
some honey, from the honey-comb, and that a bee,
having been concealed in it, entered the glottis, and
occasioned almost immediate death by suffocation;
the other case was that of an infant, <i>Mary Bacon</i>,
who fell with her face upon a quantity of slacked lime,
when a particle of it getting into the wind-pipe, produced
inflammation of the lungs, and sloughing of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>the trachea, of which she died. We have no doubt
but that <a id='per'></a>persons, during the state of intoxication, or
that of a spasmodic paroxysm, have often perished
from suffocation, when the death has been attributed
to other causes; if the stomach should reject its contents
during a state of insensibility<a id='r51' /><a href='#f51' class='c011'><sup>[51]</sup></a>, such an occurrence
is by no means unlikely. We have lately received
the history of a case of this description, which
occurred in the St. James’s workhouse, and fell under
the particular notice of Mr. <i>Alcock</i>. The patient was
seized after a hearty meal of pork with an epileptic
fit, during which he died; when upon opening the
trachea, it was found to contain a quantity of animal
matter resembling the pork upon which he had recently
dined.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>
  <h2 id='c8' class='c008'>8. DEATH BY EXPOSURE TO COLD.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>That an animal must perish as soon as the temperature
of the medium in which it lives ceases to
preserve the blood in a state of fluidity, is one of
those self-evident propositions which scarcely requires
notice, much less explanation; but that a degree of
cold not sufficiently intense to occasion any physical
changes upon the constituent parts of the body should
extinguish its vitality is a fact, whose history involves
some of the most interesting questions of physiology.</p>

<p class='c000'>The degree of cold, necessary for the production of
its fatal effects, varies in a very remarkable degree
with the strength and circumstances of the individual
to whom it is applied, as well as with the rapidity of
the cooling process. In some instances we find that
man has endured an extreme degree of cold with but
little inconvenience, whilst in other cases, we see him
perishing from it in a temperature at which water
even retains its fluidity. The interesting history
of Sir <i>Joseph Bankes</i> (at that time Mr. Bankes), Dr.
<i>Solander</i>, and eleven others, on a botanical excursion
to the mountains of Terra del Fuego; and more recently,
the narrative of our enterprizing countrymen,
in their voyage to the Polar seas, will furnish a good
illustration of the former fact, whilst the melancholy
fate of the Cambridge student, as hereafter explained,
affords a curious and instructive example of the latter.
<em>Animal heat</em>, as Mr. <i>Brodie</i> observes, <em>is in some
way or other dependant upon the integrity of the functions
of the Nervous System</em>; and consequently the
absolute degree of cold which an animal can bear
with impunity will, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">cæteris paribus</span></i>, be determined
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>by his powers of producing heat; we must therefore
cease to regard the fact as extraordinary, that an
animal, which is under the influence of a deleterious
narcotic poison, or in whom, from any other morbid
cause, the powers of the nervous system are exhausted,
may be destroyed by a diminished temperature, that
would scarcely affect even the sensations of one, differently
placed in relation to his nervous energy;
thus it is with a person in the last stage of intoxication,
in whom the powers of life are ebbing, in consequence
of the previous state of morbid excitement;
in the course of the last winter, two instances occurred
of drunken persons being taken to the watch-house;
where, there not being any charge against them, they
were dismissed by the constable of the night, and
perished in the streets. A military friend has lately
communicated to us an instance, where out of a great
number of troops who were exposed to intense cold,
the only one who perished was under the influence of
intoxication; and we learn from <i>Le Baume’s</i> interesting
account of the campaign in Russia, that similar
results were observed during the disastrous retreat
of the French army on that memorable occasion.</p>

<p class='c000'>In our own country scarcely a winter passes without
the occurrence of some event equally illustrative
of this physiological fact; and it is highly important
that the medical jurist should be able to appreciate
its influence; those who perish in this manner are
generally individuals of the most wretched condition,
and will be found to have undergone much suffering
and privation; by which their nervous energy had
been too much exhausted to generate sufficient heat
to counteract the diminished temperature of the atmosphere;
an event of this nature occurred in London
during the winter of 1819, when a man and his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>wife, aged persons, and poor, but not supposed, nor
indeed proved to have been quite destitute, were
found dead in their apartment, although food was
discovered in the room, and money was in the pocket
of the man: the night (28th of December) had been
inclement, and there was neither bed nor fire in the
miserable couple’s apartment. It appeared in evidence
that they had been previously ailing. The
verdict recorded that they had perished from the inclemency
of the weather, in consequence of the destitute
circumstances under which they were found.</p>

<p class='c000'>It would seem that persons who are long exposed
to intense cold do not suffer a painful death; they
gradually lose their sensibility, become drowsy, and
die as if through the effects of an opiate. Mr. <i>Brodie</i><a id='r52' /><a href='#f52' class='c011'><sup>[52]</sup></a>
classes the effects of cold in the following order.</p>

<p class='c000'>1. It lessens the irritability, and impairs the functions
of the whole nervous system.</p>

<p class='c000'>2. It impairs the contractile powers of the muscles.</p>

<p class='c000'>3. It causes contraction of the capillaries, and thus
lessens the superficial circulation, and stops the
cutaneous secretion.</p>

<p class='c000'>4. It probably destroys the principle of vitality,
equally in every part, and does not exclusively
disturb the functions of any particular organ.</p>

<p class='c000'>These positions have been confirmed by experiment.
Dr. <i>Chassat</i> states that in an animal immersed
in a cold bath, death may take place at 79° Fahr.
(26 <i>Centig.</i>), although it may be sometimes cooled
down as low as 69° (17 <i>Cent.</i>) before it dies; but,
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">cæteris paribus</span></i>, the animal dies sooner as the cooling
is more rapid.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>M. <i>Portal</i> thinks that cold produces death by inducing
apoplexy, and remarks that the examination
of the bodies of persons who have died from cold,
proves the presence of sanguineous congestions in the
vessels and cavities of the body, and especially in
those of the brain. Dr. <i>Cooke</i>, however, has remarked
that “M. <i>Portal’s</i> notions on this subject seem to want
confirmation. Excessive cold undoubtedly produces,
first drowsiness and afterwards a profound sleep, in
which the unfortunate individual generally perishes;
but we have not on record a sufficient number of cases
with particular descriptions of symptoms and appearances
on dissection, to enable us to say positively that
cold kills by apoplexy.”</p>

<p class='c000'>After death the blood is generally florid in the aorta,
so that the animal does not die of suffocation; the
heart sometimes contracts feebly after the muscular
irritability of the limbs and intestines are nearly destroyed;
the cerebral veins contain but little blood;
the ventricles contain a small portion of fluid. Mr.
<i>Brodie’s</i> experiments coincide in most respects with
those of Dr. <i>Chassat</i>, who uniformly found after
death, the heart much distended with blood, as in
Syncope, scarlet blood occupying the left side; and
he also found that the heart ceased to contract before
the diaphragm, so that he has seen the animal insensible,
and gasp for breath, even after the chest was
opened and the heart excised! The muscles were
unusually florid, and the peristaltic motions of the
intestines were generally observed to continue longer
than the action of the heart. The voluntary muscles,
he says, lose their irritability in different degrees,
those of the legs before those of the thighs, and those
of the thighs before the abdominal muscles.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>
  <h3 class='c013'>DEATH BY THE AGENCY OF HEAT.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c014'>We have not yet a sufficient number of well reported
experiments on the effects of heat on animals,
to enable us to draw any satisfactory conclusions
respecting the mode in which life is destroyed by this
agent; although it seems probable that it acts by destroying
the muscular energy of the heart and diaphragm.<a id='r53' /><a href='#f53' class='c011'><sup>[53]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. <i>Brodie</i> placed a rabit in a basket in an oven,
the temperature of which was not more that 150°, and
it died in a few minutes without any apparent suffering;
the heart was afterwards found distended with
blood, on both sides, as in Syncope.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>DEATH BY LIGHTNING.</h3>

<p class='c014'>It has been incontrovertibly established by the experiments
of modern philosophers, that the phœnomena
of electricity are identical with those of thunder
and lightning. The human body is alike affected by
both; and death, whether it be occasioned by the discharge
of an electrical battery, or by that of a thunder
cloud, exhibits effects precisely analogous.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. <i>Hunter</i> supposed that when death is thus occasioned,
there is an instantaneous and entire annihilation
of the vital principle, in every part of the animal
machine; and that the muscles are therefore relaxed,
and incapable of contraction, that the limbs do not
stiffen<a id='r54' /><a href='#f54' class='c011'><sup>[54]</sup></a>, as in other cases of death, nor the blood
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>coagulate, and that the body very speedily runs into
a state of putrefaction. The experiments however
of Mr. <i>Brodie</i><a id='r55' /><a href='#f55' class='c011'><sup>[55]</sup></a> will induce us to pause, and institute
farther enquiries before we receive this theory as
unexceptionable. It will appear that in the following
experiments of this physiologist, an instantaneous
extinction of vitality did not take place, but, on the
contrary, the functions of the brain were those on
which the electric shock exercised its primary influence.
An electric battery of six jars having been
charged with electricity, the shock was made to pass
through a Guinea pig, in the longitudinal direction
from the head to the tail: the animal immediately
fell on one side, insensible, as if stunned; a convulsive
action of the muscles of the extremities was observed,
but did not long continue; and the function
of respiration was not interrupted. In a few minutes
sensibility was restored, and the animal recovered.
A shock from a battery of nine jars was then passed
in the same manner through another Guinea pig;
the animal immediately fell on its side, exhibited a
convulsive action of the voluntary muscles of the
limbs, but uttered no cries, and although attentively
watched, no signs of respiration could be discovered
after the shock had passed through it. Three minutes
afterwards, Mr. <i>Brodie</i> opened the chest, and
found the heart acting with regularity and vigour,
about 80 times in a minute, and circulating
dark coloured venous blood; the peristaltic motion
of the intestines was likewise visible; and the muscles,
when made the part of a galvanic circuit, readily
contracted. In this experiment, observes Mr. <i>Brodie</i>,
it is evident that the electric shock did not destroy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>the irritability of the muscular fibre, nor did it affect
the action of the heart. <em>Death took place precisely in
the same manner as from a severe injury of the head</em>;
and the animal died, manifestly from the destruction
of the functions of the brain; and, in this case, Mr.
<i>Brodie</i> has no doubt, but that if the lungs had been
artificially inflated, the action of the heart might have
been maintained, and the animal probably have been
restored to life.</p>

<p class='c000'>The nature and extent of the injury inflicted by
lightning, depend upon the intensity and direction of
the electrical discharge, and vary greatly in degree;
by far the greater number of flashes are harmless
discharges from one cloud to another, and the instances
in which it strikes the earth are comparatively
rare: when however this does occur, and it directs
its course through a human being, it may expend its
influence upon the surface, and produce partial or
general vesications.<a id='r56' /><a href='#f56' class='c011'><sup>[56]</sup></a> Sometimes the clothes of the
person have been violently rent, and the metallic
substances about them melted; or it may pass through
the body, without including the clothes, and it may
occasion death without injuring the organic structure
of any part of the body: or it may pass through
only a particular portion of the body, and produce
local injury.</p>

<p class='c000'>But it has happened that persons have been struck
when the tempest has appeared to be at a considerable
distance; this has been explained by Signor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span><i>Beccaria</i>, by supposing that it is a discharge of electric
fluid from the earth, occasioned by the passing
of a cloud that has just before, in the elemental strife,
been rendered negatively electric. Lord <i>Stanhope</i>
distinguishes such a discharge by the name of the
<em>Returning Stroke</em>.<a id='r57' /><a href='#f57' class='c011'><sup>[57]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>As a provision for personal security during a thunder
storm, a few precautions are necessary, and we
are induced to notice them in this place, as their
history is necessarily involved in our enquiries concerning
death by lightning. In the open air, shelter
ought not to be sought immediately under trees, for
should they be struck, such a situation would be attended
with the most imminent peril: on the contrary,
the distance of twenty or thirty feet from such
objects, may be considered as affording a place of
safety, for should a discharge take place, they will
most likely receive it, and the less elevated bodies
will escape. Any surface of water, and even the
streamlets that may have resulted from a recent shower
should be avoided, for being excellent conductors,
the height of a man, when connected with them, is
very likely to determine the course of an electrical
discharge. The partial conductors, through which
the lightning directs its course when it enters a
building, are usually the appendages of the walls and
partitions; the most secure situation is therefore the
middle of the room, and this situation may be rendered
still more secure by lying on a hair mattress,
or even on a thick woollen hearth rug. The part of
every building least likely to receive injury is the
middle story, as the lightning does not always pass
from the clouds to the earth, but is occasionally discharged
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>from the earth to the clouds, as in the case of
the “<em>returning stroke</em>;” hence it is absurd to take refuge
in a cellar, as recommended by Dr. <i>Priestley</i>; indeed
many instances are on record, in which the basement
story has been the only part of a building that
has sustained severe injury, the electric charge being
divided and weakened as it ascended. Any approach
to a fire-place should be particularly avoided, for the
chimneys are very likely to determine the course of
the lightning; the same caution is necessary with
respect to gilt furniture, bell-wires, and moderately
extensive surfaces of metal of every description.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>DEATH BY STARVATION.</h3>

<p class='c014'>That a living animal body cannot long survive without
the ingestion of alimentary matter, is too self-evident
to require demonstration. Living bodies, says
<i>Cuvier</i>, may be considered as a kind of furnaces
into which inert substances are successively thrown,
which combine among themselves in various manners,
maintain a certain place, and perform an action determined
by the nature of the combinations they have
formed, and at last fly off in order to become again
subject to the laws of inanimate nature.</p>

<p class='c000'>It must, however, be observed, that there is a difference,
depending on age and health, in the proportion
of the parts which enter into the current, and those
which abandon it; and that the velocity of the motion
usually varies according to the different conditions of
each living body; hence it follows, that the period
during which an individual may exist without food,
will be liable to variation. We have already stated
(page <a href='#Page_394'>394</a>) that, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">cæteris paribus</span></i>, he will perish from
inanition with a rapidity proportioned to his youth,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>and state of robust vigour; and we remarked in what
strict conformity with physiological principles the
poet <i>Dante</i> had described the fate of <i>Ugolino</i> and his
family.<a id='r58' /><a href='#f58' class='c011'><sup>[58]</sup></a> The same fact appears also to have been
well understood by the ancient physicians;<a id='r59' /><a href='#f59' class='c011'><sup>[59]</sup></a> equally
evident is it that women are able to support abstinence
longer than men. It has been also observed
that a moist atmosphere contributes to the protraction
of life, under circumstances of privation; this
may depend, not only upon the fluid matter thus
furnished to the body, but upon the non-conducting
power of the medium, in relation to aqueous vapour;
the ingestion of a very small proportion of water revives
in an extraordinary degree, the animal perishing
from famine, and prolongs his existence. <i>Redi</i><a id='r60' /><a href='#f60' class='c011'><sup>[60]</sup></a>
instituted a series of experiments with the sole view
of ascertaining how long animals can live without
food. Of a number of capons which he kept without
either solid or liquid food, not one survived the ninth
day; but one to which he allowed water, drank it
with avidity, and did not perish until the twentieth
day. <i>Elizabeth Woodcock</i>, who was buried under the
snow, near Cambridge, for the space of eight days,
undoubtedly owed her preservation to the snow which
she occasionally sucked.<a id='r61' /><a href='#f61' class='c011'><sup>[61]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Those cases of extraordinary fasting, which are recorded
in the different Transactions and Journals of
almost every country, are to be generally regarded as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>gross impositions; we<a id='r62' /><a href='#f62' class='c011'><sup>[62]</sup></a> have already exposed the fallacy
of several of the more popular histories of this
kind. Such impostors, however, in their attempt to
delude the world, have unintentionally offered themselves
as the voluntary victims of physiological experiment;
for we have at least learnt from them how small
a portion of aliment is sufficient to preserve the life of
a human being; a fact which had never before been
satisfactorily proved, however probable it had been
rendered, by the recorded habits of many of the early
Christians, especially those of the East, who retired
from persecution into the deserts of Arabia and
Egypt.</p>

<p class='c000'>The sufferings of a person perishing from inanition<a id='r63' /><a href='#f63' class='c011'><sup>[63]</sup></a>
must be considered as the most acute that can befall
humanity; and yet we have instances on record of
their having been voluntarily encountered as the
means of suicide; a very interesting and well-authenticated
instance of this kind has been related
as having occurred in Corsica;<a id='r64' /><a href='#f64' class='c011'><sup>[64]</sup></a> and, as it is calculated
to afford, at once, a history of the symptoms
of Starvation, and an exemplification of their severity,
we shall introduce a brief account of the case
in this place. <i>Luc Antoine Viterbi</i> was condemned
to death as an accomplice in the assassination of
<i>Frediani</i>, a crime which he denied to the last moment,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>and appealed against a sentence passed upon him by
a Court composed of his personal enemies. Towards
the end of November, <i>Viterbi</i> (knowing his condemnation,
and being confined in the prison of Bastia),
resolved to die. To effect his purpose, he abstained
from food for three days, and then ate voraciously,
and to a forced excess, in the hope that, after fasting
so long, he should thereby put an end to his existence;
in this however he was deceived, and, on the second
of December, he determined to starve himself to
death; from that day nothing could shake his awful
resolution, although he did not expire until the night
of the 21st of that month. During the three first days,
<i>Viterbi</i> felt himself progressively tormented by hunger;
under these circumstances a report was made to
the public minister, who ordered bread, water, wine,
and soup to be taken daily to his cell, and placed
conspicuously in view. No debility was manifested
during these three days, no irregular muscular movement
was remarked, his ideas continued sound, and
he wrote with his usual facility, but took no nourishment.</p>

<p class='c000'>From the 5th to the 6th, to hunger insensibly succeeded
the much more grievous suffering of thirst,
which became so acute, that on the 6th, without ever
deviating from his resolution, he began to moisten his
lips and mouth occasionally, and to gargle with a few
drops of water, to relieve the burning pain in his
throat; but he let nothing pass the organs of deglutition,
being desirous not to assuage the most insupportable
cravings, but to mitigate a pain which might
have shaken his resolution. On the 6th, his physical
powers were a little weakened; his voice was nevertheless
still sonorous, pulsation regular, and a natural
heat equally extended over his whole frame. From
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>the 3d to the 6th, he had continued to write; at
night several hours of tranquil sleep seemed to suspend
the progress of his sufferings, no change was
observable in his mental faculties, and he complained
of no local pain. Until the 10th, the thirst became
more and more insupportable; <i>Viterbi</i> merely continued
to gargle, without once swallowing a single
drop of water; but in the course of the 10th, overcome
by excess of pain, he seized the jug of water,
which was near him, and drank immoderately. During
the last three days, debility had made sensible
progress, his voice became feeble, pulsation had declined,
and the extremities were cold. <i>Viterbi</i>, however,
continued to write; and sleep, each night, still
afforded him several hours ease.</p>

<p class='c000'>From the 10th to the 12th the symptoms made a
slight progress. The constancy of <i>Viterbi</i> never
yielded an instant; he dictated his journal, and afterwards
approved and signed what had been thus written
agreeably to his dictation. During the night of the
12th, the symptoms assumed a more decided character,
debility was extreme, pulsation scarcely sensible,
his voice extraordinarily feeble, the cold had extended
itself all over the body, and the pangs of thirst were
more acute than ever. On the 13th the unhappy man
thinking himself at the point of death, again seized
the jug of water, and drank twice, after which the
cold became more severe; and congratulating himself
that death was nigh, he stretched his body on the
bed, and said to the gendarmes who were guarding
him, “Look how well I have laid myself out.” At
the expiration of a quarter of an hour, he asked for
some brandy; the keeper not having any, he called
for some wine, of which he took four spoonsful; when
he had swallowed these the cold suddenly ceased,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>heat returned, and <i>Viterbi</i> enjoyed a sleep of four
hours. On awaking (on the morning of the 13th)
and finding his powers restored, he fell into a rage
with the keeper, protesting that they had deceived
him, and then began beating his head violently against
the wall of his prison, and would inevitably have
killed himself, had he not been prevented by the
gendarmes. During the two following days he resisted
his inclination to drink, but continued to gargle
occasionally with water; during the two nights he
suffered a little from exhaustion, but in the morning
found himself rather relieved. It was then that he
penned some stanzas. On the 16th, at five o’clock
in the morning, his powers were almost annihilated,
pulsation could hardly be felt, and his voice was almost
inaudible; his body was benumbed with cold,
and it was thought that he was on the point of expiring.
At ten o’clock he began to feel better, pulsation
was more sensible, his voice strengthened, and,
finally, heat again extended over his frame, and in
this state he continued during the whole of the 17th.
From the latter day until the 20th, <i>Viterbi</i> only became
more inexorable in his resolution to die. During
the 19th, the pangs of hunger and thirst appeared
more grievous than ever; so insufferable, indeed, were
they, that for the first time, <i>Viterbi</i> let a few tears
escape him; but his invincible mind instantly spurned
this human tribute. For a moment he seemed to have
resumed his wonted energy, and said, in the presence
of his guards, and the gaoler, “I will persist, whatever
may be the consequence; my mind shall be
stronger than my body; my strength of mind does
not vary, that of my body daily becomes weaker.”
A little after this energetic expression, an icy coldness
again assailed his body, the shiverings were frequent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>and dreadful, and his loins, in particular, were seized
with a stone-like coldness, which extended itself down
his thighs. During the 19th a slight pain at intervals
affected his heart, and for the first time, he felt a
ringing sensation in his ears; at noon, on this day,
his head became heavy; his sight, however, was perfect,
and he conversed almost as usual, making some
signs with his hands.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the 20th, <i>Viterbi</i> declared to the gaoler and
physician, that he would not again moisten his mouth;
and feeling the approach of death he stretched himself,
asking, as on a former occasion, whether he was
well out, and added, “I am prepared to leave this
world.” Death did not this time betray his hopes.
On the 21st <i>Viterbi</i> was no more.</p>

<p class='c000'>In this interesting history, we receive a faithful
account of the physical effects of starvation upon a
human being, and perceive how greatly a very inconsiderable
portion of liquid is capable of producing an
invigorating effect upon the body, when in a state of
extreme inanition; but the mind of the subject before
us was stern and invincible, inflexibly bent upon self
destruction; and we therefore do not perceive the
developement of those moral effects, which in other
cases are the general consequences of starvation. The
histories of besieged towns<a id='r65' /><a href='#f65' class='c011'><sup>[65]</sup></a> would afford us ample evidence
upon this subject; and would shew that famine
destroys all the most powerful instincts of our nature.
We know not, however, a more awful illustration of
this fact than that furnished by the account of the wreck
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>of the <i>Méduse</i>,<a id='r66' /><a href='#f66' class='c011'><sup>[66]</sup></a> and its appalling consequences;
it appears that this frigate struck on the bank of
Arguin, and as all attempts to save her were fruitless,
nothing remained but to concert immediate measures
for the escape of the passengers and crew; five boats
were accordingly got in readiness, and a raft, destined
to carry the greatest number of people, was hastily
constructed; biscuit, wine, and fresh water were also
apportioned to each; but in the tumult of abandoning
the wreck, it so happened that the raft had the least
share of the provisions, and in which there was not a
single barrel of biscuit. This raft, containing no less
than one hundred and fifty souls, was to have been
towed by the boats, with which it was connected
by ropes; but the adventurers had not proceeded far,
when the boats cast off, and cruelly abandoned the
raft to the mercy of the ocean; to the scene which
ensued it is impossible for any language, however
florid, to do adequate justice. Despair, aided
by the pangs of hunger, soon excited a mutiny; a
dreadful slaughter ensued, and the flesh of their murdered
comrades afforded to the survivors a short respite
from the immediate sufferings of famine.</p>

  <h2 id='c9' class='c008'>THE APPLICATION OF THE PHYSIOLOGICAL FACTS ESTABLISHED IN THE PRECEDING CHAPTERS, TO THE GENERAL TREATMENT OF ASPHYXIA.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Although our researches into the causes and phenomena
of asphyxia, or suspended animation, will
afford, on many occasions, but very scanty encouragement
with regard to the extent and value of the resources
of art, yet we apprehend that to the intelligent
practitioner they will not on that account be less
acceptable; for to him it must be well known, that
the detection of error is the first step in the discovery
of truth, and although the tendency of the present
investigation will be to reject, as useless, many of
those plans of treatment which have long enjoyed the
confidence of the public and the profession; yet it will
suggest the application of some that have not hitherto
been duly appreciated, and regulate that of others
whose efficiency entirely depends upon the time and
manner of their administration. But the fact is not
to be concealed, that the medical profession, as well
as the public, have long been too sanguine in their
estimate of the probabilities of recovery by art, in
cases <a id='whe'></a>where life is suddenly arrested by the operation
of external causes; and upon this occasion, the establishment
of the “<span class='sc'>Royal Humane Society</span> for the
recovery of persons apparently dead,” requires some
notice, in relation to the possible extent of its successful
exertions. Without some explanation it will be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>impossible to reconcile the reports of that philanthropic
institution, with the physiological views
which we have attempted to establish in the present
work; it therefore becomes a part of our duty to explain
the nature of the fallacies into which the witnesses
and reporters of cases of suspended animation
appear to us to have been unconsciously betrayed,
and which have so frequently bestowed upon fable
the colour of truth, and given to vague report, the
apparent stability of credible testimony. In the first
place we would observe, that in those cases in which
a long interval is stated to have occurred between the
suspension of breathing, from drowning, and the
restoration of that function by art, it is probable that
the anxiety of by-standers who witnessed the struggles,
and the impossibility of justly appreciating the
lapse of time in such moments of anxiety<a id='r67' /><a href='#f67' class='c011'><sup>[67]</sup></a> and distress,
have led to the erroneous statements with which
the subject is embarrassed. There is, moreover,
another fallacy into which the anxious observer is
very likely to fall,—the sufferer may have breathed
unobserved during the alleged interval of asphyxia;
and if this fact be admitted, we at once reduce some
of the most incredible of these reports to the rational
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>standard of physiological probability. Nor shall we
hesitate in the present chapter to offer our remarks
upon the plan of recovery proposed by this society
with as much freedom, and as little reserve, as we
have ventured to question the literal accuracy of their
reports. But while, thus fortified by physiological
arguments, we profess to discredit many of the results
stated by this society, let it not be supposed
that we would prefer a charge of insincerity against
their authors, or attempt to withhold any portion of
that public patronage and consideration, to which
their zeal and philanthropy so justly entitle them.</p>

<p class='c000'>The agents which are employed in cases of suspended
animation, are far too indiscriminately recommended;
some of them, without doubt, offer valuable
resources to the physician, and only require a
judicious application to ensure their success; while
others are entirely useless and frivolous, and ought
to be dismissed from our service, since the retaining
them only embarrasses the practitioner, and that too
at a period which of all others requires the utmost
decision in the selection of a plan of treatment, and
the greatest promptness in its execution.</p>

<p class='c000'>The following may be considered as the principal
resources upon which the <i>Humane Society</i> rely for
restoration of persons apparently dead from sudden
accidents, viz.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>We shall offer a few observations upon the methods
of applying these agents.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>On the manner of producing artificial respiration.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>We are indebted to <i>Mr. Brodie</i> for the valuable
directions that are to guide the execution of this important
operation. (<cite>Manuscript Notes.</cite>) A common
pair of bellows will be found as manageable and efficient
an apparatus for the inflation of the lungs, as any
instrument that could be contrived; those manufactured
for the service of the Humane Society are not
of a size sufficient to inflate the lungs of even a large
dog, much less those of man; nor is it necessary to
employ double bellows on this occasion, for the air
will escape from the lungs without being withdrawn
by suction; besides which, it is stated that the forcible
exhaustion of the lungs is liable to occasion pulmonic
hemorrhage. It has been proposed to insert the tube
of the bellows into the trachea, by means of a wound
in that structure, but there are great objections to
such a proceeding; the hemorrhage which is likely to
occur,<a id='r68' /><a href='#f68' class='c011'><sup>[68]</sup></a> may inundate the windpipe; besides which,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>the operation occasions delay, which, however trifling,
will be important in cases where the action of
the heart has become much enfeebled; and moreover
the wound itself is an evil which ought to be avoided,
if artificial respiration can be established without it;
and were these objections even overruled, there still
remains another; experience has shewn that the air
thus introduced issues by the opening of the larynx,
without having dilated the lungs.</p>

<p class='c000'>A tube may be constructed for the purpose of being
inserted through the mouth into the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">rima glottidis</span></i>; if
the patient be sensible, the introduction of such a tube
might be difficult; but as the patient is in a state of
insensibility, the introduction may usually be effected
without much difficulty, but not altogether without
trouble; for the mere circumstance of having to open
the mouth, to pull forward the epiglottis, to direct
the tube into the proper aperture, may occasion delay
which will be of importance in cases where success
depends upon the skill with which the time has been
economised.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is for such reasons more expedient to inflate the
lungs by means of a tube inserted into one nostril,
keeping the other and the mouth carefully closed:
the bellows having been thus disposed, the air should
be driven into the lungs with a certain degree of
force; the lungs will thus become fully inflated, and
in the intervals between the different inflations, the
air from the lungs will escape by the mouth and by
the other nostril, and when the lungs are thus
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>emptied, the process may be repeated. There is but
one objection to this method of exciting artificial respiration,
viz. that at each inflation, a portion of air
will sometimes find its way into the stomach, through
the œsophagus: it is very desirable to prevent such an
occurrence, for when the stomach is much distended
with air, the descent of the diaphragm is prevented,
and, consequently, a perfect inspiration cannot be
accomplished. The passage of air into the stomach
may be prevented by pressing on the thyroid cartilage,
so as to close the communication between the pharynx
and œsophagus. All that is necessary for the operator
is, to produce the inspiration; we are recommended
indeed to press the margin of the ribs gently
upwards, so as to expel the air, and produce expiration;
but this is altogether unnecessary, for the elasticity
of the ribs, and the pressure of the abdominal
muscles and viscera, and the elasticity of the lungs
themselves, are quite sufficient to occasion the expiration
without any assistance from external pressure.
We must not omit to state that the inhalation of oxygen
gas, instead of common air, has been strongly
recommended, not only as being in itself a more
powerful stimulus, but as being more efficient in the
removal of the accumulation of that carbonized matter
which, under ordinary circumstances of respiration,
is regularly thrown off; the practical eligibility
however, of such a plan is very questionable, and to
say nothing of the difficulty of obtaining oxygen
upon an occasion where the least delay is fatal, it is
very doubtful whether the effects of this gas are really
such as our theory would at once lead us to believe.
We have deemed it necessary to enter into these details,
in order to afford some practical instruction
upon a subject of manipulation but little understood,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>but which is undoubtedly the most valuable of all the
resources which art can furnish for the preservation of
human beings that are in danger of perishing from
accidental causes. The principal circumstances to be
remembered are comprised in the following precepts.</p>

<p class='c015'>1. The lungs are to be sufficiently, but not too
much inflated.</p>
<p class='c015'>2. The inspiration must be made of sufficient frequency.</p>
<p class='c015'>3. The air is to be allowed a free exit from the
lungs, so that the same air shall not be transmitted
more than once.</p>
<p class='c015'>4. The method of inflating the lungs must be
simple, and easy of adoption; for as the interval
of time, during which the artificial respiration
can possibly be of any service, is
very limited, it is important to avoid whatever
may occasion the least delay.</p>

<h4 class='c016'><i>Application of Heat.</i></h4>

<p class='c014'>There is perhaps no medium through which
we can more successfully apply heat to the human
body than that of the bath, because we can manage
its application with precision; we know the exact
degree of heat, and can avoid applying it in extremes;
we, at the same time, can communicate it more rapidly,
and more equally, than by any other means,
and we are enabled to increase or diminish the temperature,
by the addition of fresh portions of water,
as circumstances may render it expedient.</p>

<p class='c014'>The introduction of fluids into the stomach is not
an easy process in many cases of suspended animation,
as <i>trismus</i> is by no means an uncommon occurrence;
where, however, the spasm of the jaw has
subsided, the practitioner with a little address may
by means of a flexible tube easily accomplish his object.
Glysters will likewise furnish an easy mode of
applying stimulants.</p>

<h5 class='c016'><i>Electricity.</i></h5>

<p class='c014'>No sooner was the discovery made that galvanism is
capable of exciting muscular contraction in animals
apparently dead, than the physiological enthusiast
seized it with avidity, and at once hailed it as the long
desired influence that was to restore vigour to the enfeebled,
and resuscitation to those that were in a state
of suspended animation. It had been long known
that muscles could be made to contract, by irritating
the nerves belonging to them with the point of the
scalpel, but not in a degree that remotely approached
the vigorous contractions occasioned by the galvanic
influence, whose stimulus seemed almost equivalent
to that of volition. The sanguine expectations, however,
which were thus very naturally excited, have
ended in the most complete disappointment; and we
are bound to confess that although <em>galvanism is capable
of exciting extraordinary contractions in the</em> <span class='fss'>VOLUNTARY</span>
<em>muscles, and of astonishing the multitude,
yet its influence does not extend to those that are</em> <span class='fss'>INVOLUNTARY</span>.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span><i>Bichat</i> states distinctly that <em>the involuntary
muscles are beyond the reach of galvanism</em>.<a id='r69' /><a href='#f69' class='c011'><sup>[69]</sup></a>
Mr. <i>Brodie</i> has frequently attempted to restore the
heart’s action by the galvanic stimulus, in an animal
dead from syncope, but never with success. The
author of the present work may add, that he has attempted
the same object by modifying the experiment
in several different ways, but with no better success.
But it may be said that, as galvanism will excite the
contractions of the diaphragm, and other muscles of
respiration, it may be made subservient to the purpose
of producing artificial respiration: granted,—but it
never can be made to act with the certainty, regularity,
promptness, or convenience, which attend the
operation of a common pair of bellows, nor even if it
could, would any advantage be obtained which might
not be equally insured by the use of this latter simple
instrument. It is, moreover, questionable whether
so powerful a stimulus may not produce a subsequent
exhaustion of the muscular energy; such effect indeed
would appear to have happened in the case related
by Dr. <i>Babington</i>, where the asphyxia had been
occasioned by the fumes of burning charcoal; “having
passed,” says he, “a galvanic shock through the chest,
the patient instantly, to our surprise, drew his breath
deep; the muscles of the abdomen were seen to react,
though feebly, while those of the face were
slightly convulsed, and the eyelids were raised; at
each successive application of this powerful agent, the
respirations were more forcibly performed, and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>stroke of the artery at the wrist rose in the same proportion.
Having procured a bladder filled with
oxygen gas, we caused it to be inspired, and we
thought that it was followed by an increased activity
of the powers of respiration and circulation; as the
heat of the body was not deficient, we now sprinkled
the face and chest with cold water, which also had
the effect of rousing the dormant powers of sensation,
as the respiratory muscles were uniformly thrown by
it into action, though in a more feeble and interrupted
manner than when we employed the galvanic
influence. Having received a large supply of oxygen
gas, we repeated the inhalation and the galvanic
succussions alternately, through the chest and head,
every half-hour, for three hours, when the galvanic
influence was discontinued, as the heart, though
uniformly excited by it, seemed in the intervals to
act more feebly, and we were apprehensive that by
exalting the action of one power continually, we
might destroy that equilibrium of forces which is necessary
to the maintenance of life.”<a id='r70' /><a href='#f70' class='c011'><sup>[70]</sup></a></p>

  <h2 class='c008'>TREATMENT OF PARTICULAR CASES OF ASPHYXIA.</h2>
</div>
<h3 class='c016'>CASE I.<br /> <br /><i>Wherein the action of the heart fails before that of the respiratory organs.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>In no case of this description can artificial inflation
of the lungs afford the least assistance, for the left
side of the heart always contains florid blood at the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>moment of its cessation; and since this fact proves
that it failed in its action, while under the full influence
of duly oxygenized blood, how can we expect
that the stimulus, which was unable to preserve the
heart’s action while yet in motion, shall be able to
re-excite it after it has ceased? Such a practice
can only have been suggested by that erroneous
physiology which maintained that the motion of the
lungs excited that of the blood.</p>

<p class='c000'>The preservation of the body from the influence of
external cold is always important, for it is only
within a certain range of temperature that the vital
functions can be performed; and during a state of
asphyxia, the body is necessarily incapable of generating
any portion of animal heat; where the heat is
lost it should be gradually restored, and for such a
purpose the introduction of wine, the volatile alkali,
and other stimulants, into the stomach, by means of
a flexible tube, would probably, in certain states of
syncope, prove serviceable; although in cases of suffocation
it can never occasion the least benefit. We
have been also directed to employ frictions on the
surface of the body, for the purpose of assisting the
circulation of the blood; as if, says Mr. <i>Brodie</i>, (<cite>Manuscript
Notes</cite>) this could answer any useful purpose
where the action of the heart has ceased, or as if it
could be necessary where it still continues.</p>

<p class='c000'>Under the head ‘death from cold,’ we have stated
that the left cavities of the heart contain florid blood;
it therefore follows that the directions of the Humane
Society, to inflate the lungs in such cases, are founded
<a id='in'></a>in error.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>
  <h3 class='c013'>CASE II.<br /> <br /><i>Wherein the function of respiration ceases, while the heart continues to circulate black blood.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c014'>It has been stated that in cases of suffocation the
heart continues to contract for a short period, after
the cessation of breathing; that this interval is extremely
short, but liable to vary from several causes;
and that it is uniformly shorter in cases of death by
drowning, than in those by strangulation. To the
physician this is an interval of anxiety and importance;
let him beware how he trifles with the fleeting
moments, in which alone the resources of his art can
be of any avail. If artificial respiration be established
at this period, the blood will become once more oxygenised,
the action of the heart will be continued,
the scarlet blood will be transmitted to the brain, and
sensibility will therefore return; the nervous energy
will be once more transmitted to the respiratory organs,
and the animal will at length make a voluntary
effort to inspire air. Here then is the interval
of time, during which artificial breathing may be employed
so as to effect a restoration to life, where
death must otherwise have been inevitable. Mr.
<i>Brodie</i> has made a great variety of interesting experiments
upon this subject, from which may be deduced
the following important corollaries.</p>

<p class='c015'>1. If the lungs be inflated, the action of the heart
will continue.</p>
<p class='c015'>2. If the action of the heart has become feeble, but
the circulation is nevertheless not entirely suspended,
the inflation of the lungs will cause the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>feeble actions to become again frequent and
vigorous.</p>
<p class='c015'>3. If the action of the heart has entirely ceased, it
is impossible to restore it by the inflation of
the lungs.</p>
<p class='c015'>4. If the action of the heart has not entirely ceased,
but is so feeble as no longer to maintain the
circulation, the artificial respiration will prove
as useless, as if the heart were perfectly motionless.</p>

<p class='c000'>There is still, however, another period at which
artificial respiration may be employed with the greatest
advantage; we have stated that after the natural
respiration has been re-established, and the animal
would appear to be advancing towards recovery, it
not unfrequently relapses into a state of insensibility,
becomes convulsed, and dies. As this depends upon
the black blood which is circulating through the
brain, so paralysing that organ as to prevent a necessary
transmission of its influence to the muscles of
respiration, life may be preserved if artificial respiration
be established until the brain is again supplied
with duly oxygenized blood; after which the
animal will be <a id='ena'></a>enabled to perform its own functions
without any assistance from art.</p>

<p class='c000'>The same treatment will, of course, apply in every
case where the natural respiration ceases in consequence
of being deprived of a due supply of nervous
energy, from the insensibility of the brain; as from a
blow on the head—the action of a narcotic poison—from
lightning?</p>

<p class='c000'>It has been proposed, in cases of suffocation, to
take away blood from some of the larger veins; as far
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>as relates to the asphyxia, no advantage can accrue
from such a practice, but incidental benefit may arise
where congestion has taken place in the brain, as happens
in hanging: in such cases the jugular veins are
those from which the blood can be taken with the
greatest chance of success.</p>

<p class='c000'>Advantage is also said to accrue from the application
of volatile alkali, or other pungent bodies to the
inside of the nostrils; whatever promotes sneezing
or coughing is supposed to give a succussion to the
diaphragm and its antagonist muscles, and thereby
to promote the re-establishment of respiration.</p>

<p class='c000'>Cordials, moderate warmth, and quiet, are the resources
upon which we are to rely for the ultimate
recovery of the vital powers, after the complete establishment
of the function of respiration.</p>

<p class='c000'>For a long period, injections of tobacco enjoyed a
high, but unmerited reputation amongst the medicinal
agents that were supposed capable of rousing the
latent energies of life, in cases of suspended animation;
and strange as it may appear, this most powerful
narcotic poison, until within a few years, was
annually recommended for such purposes by those
who professed to instruct the profession and the
public upon these important topics; this may be
considered as one of the most stupendous errors that
ever occurred in the exercise of the medical art.</p>

<p class='c000'>Where the asphyxia has arisen from the inhalation
of noxious vapours, as those emitted by burning
charcoal, the exposure of the body to cold has been
strongly recommended. In Russia, where from the
mode of heating the dwellings, accidents of this kind
very frequently occur, the general practice is to rub
the body with snow, and it is said with the happiest
effect; this plan, says Dr. <i>Babington</i>, is probably of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>use, from the strong impression which is made upon
the skin as a sentient organ. It is also a well known
fact, that the recovery of the dogs which are made the
subjects of experiment in the <i>Grotto del Cane</i>, is much
favoured by their being plunged into a neighbouring
lake.</p>

<p class='c000'>Is it necessary to repeat, that the idea respecting
the presence of any considerable portion of water in
the lungs of a drowned person, has no foundation in
truth? we should have scarcely deemed the notice of
such a fallacy, and that of the practice founded upon
it, of hanging by the heels, called for in this place,
had not an opinion been lately delivered, by a medical
witness, that <em>a person drowned in the Thames
might possibly have been recovered, but for the impurity
of the water, arising from the gas-works</em>. We
have only to observe upon this occasion, that had the
individual in question recovered in the hands of a
practitioner who could have delivered so absurd an
opinion, he would have been more indebted to good
fortune than to skilful attention.</p>

<p class='c000'>A drowned animal will, in general, be recovered
more slowly and with greater difficulty than one
which has fallen into a state of asphyxia from strangulation.
It is probable that, in the former case,
the sudden reduction of temperature will contribute
to the more rapid extinction of vitality.</p>

<p class='c000'>Having thus examined the pretensions to which the
several modes of restoring animation are entitled,
we may conveniently introduce in this place some
observations upon the different methods which have
been adopted to secure condemned criminals against
the fatal effects of their execution. There can be no
doubt but that by making an opening in the trachea,
below the ligature, death might in some cases be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>prevented, provided the neck were not dislocated,
nor the weight of the body very considerable. <i>Richerand</i>
says, that a surgeon of the imperial armies,
whose veracity cannot be questioned, assured him
that he had saved the life of a soldier by performing
the operation of laryngotomy some hours before he
was executed.</p>

<p class='c000'>Dr. <i>Male</i><a id='r71' /><a href='#f71' class='c011'><sup>[71]</sup></a> states that it was tried on one <i>Gordon</i>,
a butcher, who was executed at the Old Bailey
in the early part of the last century; the body having
hung the usual time, was removed to a neighbouring
house, where a surgeon waited to receive it,
and enforce every means calculated to restore animation:
he opened his eyes, and sighed, but soon expired:
the want of success was attributed to his great
weight, but we apprehend that, if the statement be
correct as to his opening his eyes and sighing, the
failure must have depended upon want of skill in the
operators. We have yet to notice those cases of
spontaneous recovery which have taken place after
execution, and which are too well authenticated to
admit of doubt; upon this point we would observe,
that such results by no means militate against the
accuracy of the physiological views which have been
already presented to our readers. Whenever such a
recovery occurs, the strangulation has never been
complete, and feeble motions of the heart have been
preserved by imperfect and occasional respirations,
during the interval of suspension; this may depend,
in a great measure, upon the situation of the noose;
if placed at the side of the neck, it would be pulled
tight by the weight of the body; but if at the back
of the neck, it would be far otherwise. <i>John Smith</i>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>who was executed at Tyburn on the 24th of December
1705, was cut down in consequence of the arrival
of a reprieve, nearly fifteen minutes after he had
been turned off, but is said to have been recovered
by venesection and other means<a id='r72' /><a href='#f72' class='c011'><sup>[72]</sup></a>; Governor <i>Wall</i> was
a long time in the act of dying, and it was subsequently
discovered that this was owing to an ossified
portion of the trachea resisting the pressure of the
rope; but the most extraordinary instance of this
kind, and one well authenticated, is that of <i>Margaret
Dickson</i>, of Musselburgh, who was tried and convicted
in Edinburgh in the year 1728, for the murder
of her child; her conviction was accomplished
by the evidence of a medical person, who deposed
that <em>the lungs of the child swam in water</em>; there were,
however, strong reasons to suspect the justness of the
verdict, and the sequel of the story was well calculated
to cherish a superstitious belief on the occasion.
After execution, her body was cut down, and delivered
to her friends for the rites of interment; it was
accordingly placed in a coffin, and sent in a cart to
be buried at her native place, but the weather being
sultry, the persons who had the body in charge
stopped to drink, at a village called Peppermill,
about two miles from Edinburgh; while they were
refreshing themselves, one of them perceived the lid
of the coffin move, and uncovering it, the woman
immediately sat up, and most of the spectators ran
away with every sign of trepidation; a person,
however, who was in the public house immediately
bled her, and in about an hour she was put to bed,
and by the following morning, was so far recovered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>as to be able to walk to her own house<a id='r73' /><a href='#f73' class='c011'><sup>[73]</sup></a>, after
which she lived twenty-five years and had several
children.<a id='r74' /><a href='#f74' class='c011'><sup>[74]</sup></a></p>

  <h2 id='c10' class='c008'>OF THE CORONER’s INQUEST.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The office of Coroner (<i>Coronator</i>, from his duty
in Pleas of the Crown, 2d Inst. 31. 4. Inst. 271)
which is of great antiquity, was also of considerable
dignity;<a id='r75' /><a href='#f75' class='c011'><sup>[75]</sup></a> for the Coroner, together with the Sheriff,
was to keep the peace of the county. He is to be
elected by the full county, and for life (except in cases
of misconduct, when he may be removed). The writ
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">De Coronatore eligendo</span></i>, F.N.B. 163, commands the
Sheriff “<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">quod talem eligi faciat, qui melius et sciat et
velit et possit officio illi intendere</span></i>”, and the 3 <i>Edw.</i> 1 <i>c.</i>
10. enacts, that none but lawful and discreet knights
should be chosen. But now it is held sufficient if he
have enough to be made a knight (1 <i>Bl. Com.</i> 347),
which is but lands to the amount of £20 per annum,
(I <i>Edw.</i> 1. <i>Stat. de milit</i>). But as the office is attended
with many unpleasant duties, gentlemen, in
these nicer times, have shrunk from its performance,
and it has consequently fallen into disrepute; and
too frequently into low and indigent hands. For
though in great counties, and some populous places,
it is held by very worthy and experienced men, yet
in remoter parts it is to be feared that it is ill exercised;
and at least, that the persons holding it have
not the learning and practice necessary for its due
execution. And this in all probability is an increasing
evil; for an office once fallen into disrepute, and
only propped by the addition of emoluments to be
derived from fees (per job), generally becomes venal;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>and there is now too much reason to fear, that decency
may be outraged by the ill-timed activity of some<a id='r76' /><a href='#f76' class='c011'><sup>[76]</sup></a>,
as much as justice is defeated by the corruption and
supineness of others, who have of late been chosen to
this ancient and once honorable office. It is therefore
to be wished that some legislative measure may
correct or prevent this evil, by restricting the elections
to persons duly qualified; and by appointing
medical assessors or inspectors, who might usefully
assist the Coroner in the discharge of his duties in
cases of inquisition of death.</p>

<p class='c000'>The statute <i>De Officio Coronatoris</i>, 4 <i>Edw.</i> 1 <i>c.</i> 2.
directs the mode in which Inquisitions of Death shall
be held. “The Coroner, when commanded by the
King’s bailiffs, or by honest men of the county, shall
go to the places where any be slain, or suddenly dead
or wounded, and shall forthwith command four of
the next towns<a id='r77' /><a href='#f77' class='c011'><sup>[77]</sup></a>, or five or six to appear before
him, in such a place; and when they are come thither,
the coroner upon the oath of them shall enquire
if they know where the person was slain;
whether it were in any house, field, bed, town, tavern,
or company, and who were there. Likewise
it is to be enquired who were culpable either of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>act or of the force; and who were present, either
men or women, of what age, if they can speak or
have any discretion. And such as are found culpable
by inquisition shall be taken and delivered to the
sheriff, and committed to gaol; and such as be found,
and be not culpable (i.e. the witnesses, and these the
coroner shall bind over by recognizance to the next
assizes,) shall be attached until the coming of the
justices<a id='r78' /><a href='#f78' class='c011'><sup>[78]</sup></a> and their names written in the coroner’s
roll. If any be slain and the body found in the fields
or woods; first, it is to be enquired whether he was
slain in the same place or not;<a id='r79' /><a href='#f79' class='c011'><sup>[79]</sup></a> and if it were
brought and laid there, endeavour shall be made to
follow their steps who brought the body thither;
whether brought upon a horse or in a cart. Also it
shall be inquired, whether the dead person were
known or a stranger, and where he lay the night
before. And if any be found culpable of the murder,
the coroner shall immediately go into his house, and
inquire what goods he has, &amp;c. how much land, and
the yearly value, and what corn on the ground, which
shall be valued and delivered to the township, which
shall be answerable before the justices for all; and
the land shall remain in the king’s hands until the
lords of the fee have made fine for it, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Also it is to be enquired of those who were drowned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>or suddenly dead; and after it is to be seen of such
bodies whether they were so drowned or slain, or
strangled by the sign of a cord tied straight about
their necks, or about any of their members, or upon
any other hurt found upon their bodies: whereupon
they shall proceed in the form above said. And if
they were slain, then ought the coroners to attach the
finders and all others in company.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Upon appeal of wounds and such like, especially
if the wounds be mortal, the parties appealed shall
be taken immediately, and kept until it be known
perfectly whether he that is hurt shall recover or
not; and if he die, the offenders shall be kept: and
if the party recover, the offenders shall be attached
by four or six pledges after, as the wound is great or
small: if it be for a maim, he shall find more than
four pledges: and two pledges if it be for a small
wound without mayhem. Also all wounds ought to
be viewed; the length, breadth, and depth, and with
what weapons, and in what part of the body the
wound or hurt is, and how many wounds there be,
and who gave them: all which must be enrolled by
the coroner.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Moreover if any be appealed, the party appealing
of the fact shall be taken, and the party appealed of
the force shall be attached also, and kept in ward,
until the parties appealed of the fact be attainted or
delivered.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Also horses, boats, carts, &amp;c. whereby any are
slain, shall be valued, and delivered unto the towns
as beforesaid.</p>

<p class='c000'>“If any be suspected of the death of any man, being
in danger of life, he shall be taken and imprisoned as
before is said.”</p>

<p class='c000'>This statute is but in confirmation of the common
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>law, and therefore does not restrain the powers of
the coroner which he before possessed, even though
they be not mentioned in it. 1 <i>East. P. C.</i> 381,

<p class='c000'>He is to inroll the verdict of his jury, written on

<p class='c000'>He must take notes of the evidence,<a id='r80' /><a href='#f80' class='c011'><sup>[80]</sup></a> and bind

<p class='c000'>The coroner among other things must enquire of
the deodand, which on the violent death of any one,
even though purely accidental, has accrued to the
king or his grantee.</p>

<p class='c000'>This mulct was, in ancient times, applied to the
purpose of purchasing masses, for the repose of the
soul of the deceased; it is now converted into an ill
apportioned, arbitrary, or, in a few cases, inadequate
fine<a id='r86' /><a href='#f86' class='c011'><sup>[86]</sup></a> on the individual, whose property has been,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>whether innocently or culpably, the cause of death.
It is as absurd that a ship under sail, from which a
man has fallen and been drowned, should be forfeited
to the king; as it is lamentable that the ignorant,
and too frequently the criminally negligent vender of
oxalic acid for Epsom salts, should escape all punishment.</p>

<p class='c000'>Where a thing is not in motion, that part of it
which actually caused the death is alone forfeited,
“as if a man be climbing on the wheel of a cart, and is
killed by falling from it, the wheel alone is a deodand.
1 <i>Bl. Com.</i> 300. But whenever the thing is in motion,
not only that part which immediately gives the wound,
(as the wheel which runs over his body) but all the
things which move with it, and help to make the
wound more dangerous (as the cart and loading,
which increase the pressure of the wheel) are forfeited.”
<i>ibid.</i> The utmost penalty of this law might
often be inflicted on the proprietors of stage coaches,
where the wilful negligence, drunkenness, or brutality
of the driver had occasioned the loss of life. “It
matters not whether the owner were concerned in the
killing or not; for, if a man kill another with my
sword, the sword is forfeited.” <i>ibid.</i> The learned
Commentator thus concludes, “But juries have of
late very frequently taken upon themselves to mitigate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>these forfeitures, by finding only some trifling
thing, or part of an entire thing, to have been the
occasion of the death. And in such cases, although
the finding of the jury be hardly warrantable by law,
the Court of King’s Bench hath generally refused to
interfere on behalf of the lord of the franchise, to
assist so unequitable a claim.” 1 <i>Com.</i> 301. Thus is
the justice of the country injured, in order to restrain
the rapacity of individuals, improperly invested with
the prerogatives of the crown. See also 1 <i>East. P. C.</i>
386.</p>

<p class='c000'>A coroner may be punished for misconduct by fine,
imprisonment, or removal; as if he be remiss in coming

<p class='c000'>We have entered more fully into this description
of the office and duties of coroner in general, as we
deem the due execution of them to be of the utmost
importance to the public welfare; not indeed
intending it as a guide to coroners themselves,
for to that purpose it would be insufficient; but to
give some insight into the nature and character of
the office, to those who may, from time to time, be
called upon to aid its administration. It is however
necessary for us to add that there are some exceptions
to the above mentioned rules, arising out of
local customs and peculiar jurisdictions; thus the
Lord Mayor of London is by virtue of his office,
coroner within the City, and the Court is holden
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>before him or his deputy. 4 <i>Inst.</i> 250. And other
places, as some of the Royal residences, &amp;c. have
their separate coroners; but all, whatever the mode
of election or appointment, are in cases of misconduct
subject to the jurisdiction of the Court of King’s
Bench.</p>

  <h2 id='c11' class='c008'>SUICIDE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Self-murder is ranked among the higher crimes,
being a peculiar species of felony, as implied in
the technical term <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">felo de se</span></i>. To constitute this
offence, the party must be in his senses, else it is
no crime; but this excuse ought not to be strained
to that length to which our coroner’s juries are
too apt to carry it,<a id='r88' /><a href='#f88' class='c011'><sup>[88]</sup></a> viz. that the very act of
suicide is an evidence of insanity; as if every man
who acts contrary to reason, had no reason at all;
for the same argument would prove every other criminal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span><i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">non compos</span></i>, as well as the self-murderer. The
law very rationally judges, that every melancholy or
hypochondriac fit does not deprive a man of the capacity
of discerning right from wrong; and, therefore,
if a real lunatic kills himself in a lucid interval, he is
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">felo de se</span></i> as much as another man. 1 <i>Hales, P. C.</i>
412. 1 <i>Hawk. P. C.</i> <i>c.</i> 27, <i>s.</i> 3.</p>

<p class='c000'>As to the punishment which human laws inflict on
this crime, they can only act upon what the criminal
has left behind him,—his reputation and fortune; on
the former, by an ignominious burial in the highway,
with a stake driven through his body; on the latter,
by the forfeiture of all his goods and chattels to the
king.</p>

<p class='c000'>In this as well as all other felonies, the offender
must be of the age of discretion, and <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">compos mentis</span></i>;
and therefore an infant killing himself, under the age
of discretion, (of which some extraordinary instances
have lately been related in the public journals) or a
lunatic during his lunacy, cannot be a <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">felo de se</span></i>. 1
<i>Hawk. P. C.</i> <i>c.</i> 27, <i>s.</i> 1. <i>Crom.</i> 30, <i>a</i> 6, 31; <i>Hales
P. C.</i> 28; <i>Dalt.</i> <i>c.</i> 92; 3 <i>Inst.</i> 54.</p>

<p class='c000'>He who kills another, though at his own desire or
command, is a murderer;<a id='r89' /><a href='#f89' class='c011'><sup>[89]</sup></a> and the person killed
is not looked upon as a <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">felo de se</span></i>, in as much as his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>assent was merely void, being against the law of God
and man; 1 <i>Hawk. P. C.</i> <i>c.</i> 27, <i>s.</i> 6; <i>Keilw.</i> 136;
<i>Moor</i> 754. But query, as he is the guilty cause of
his own death, is he not a felon? for if the question
had been of the death of another, his consent to it
would have been equally against the laws of God
and man; yet if poison were given by his direction
or command, even though he were not present, and
might have repented, it would be murder, much more
then, when he actually assists at the perpetration.</p>

<p class='c000'>Further, as to what a <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">felo de se</span></i> shall forfeit, it
seems clear that he shall forfeit all chattels, real or
personal, which he hath in his own right; and also all
chattels real, whereof he is possessed jointly with his
wife, or in her right; and also all bonds and other
personal things in action, belonging solely to himself;
and also all personal things in action, and as some say,
entire chattels in possession, to which he was entitled
jointly with another, on any account, except that of
merchandize. But it is said, that he shall forfeit a
moiety only of such joint chattels as may be severed,
and nothing at all of what he was possessed of as executor
or administrator; 1 <i>Hawk. P. C.</i> <i>c.</i> 27, <i>s.</i> 7,
and authorities there. However the blood of a <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">felo
de se</span></i> is not corrupted, nor his lands of inheritance
forfeited, nor his wife barred of her dower. 1 <i>Hawk.
P. C.</i> <i>c.</i> 27, <i>s.</i> 1; <i>Plowd. Com.</i> 261 b, 262 a; 1
<i>Hales, P. C.</i> 413. The will of a <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">felo de se</span></i> becomes
void as to his personal property, but not as to his
real estate. <i>Plowd.</i> 261.</p>

<p class='c000'>Not any part of the personal estate is vested in the
king, before the self-murder is found by some inquisition;
and consequently the forfeiture thereof is
saved by a pardon of the offence before such finding;
5 <i>Co. R.</i> 110 b; 3 <i>Inst.</i> 54; 1 <i>Saund.</i> 362; 1 <i>Sid.</i> 150,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>162. But if there be no such pardon, the whole is
forfeited immediately after such inquisition, from the
time of the act done, by which the death was caused;
and all intermediate alienations and titles are avoided.
<i>Plowd. Comm.</i> 260; <i>Hales P. C.</i> 29; 5 <i>Co. R.</i> 110;
<i>Finch.</i> 216. All such inquisitions ought to be by the
coroner <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">super visum corporis</span></i>, if the body can be
found; and an inquisition so taken cannot, as some
say, be traversed. <i>Hale, P. C.</i> 29; 3 <i>Inst.</i> 55; 1
<i>Hawk. P. C.</i> <i>c.</i> 27, <i>s.</i> 9, 10, 11. But see also 3
<i>Mod.</i> 238, 1 <i>Burr.</i> 17.</p>

<p class='c000'>But if the body cannot be found, so that the coroner,
who has authority only <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">super visum corporis</span></i>,
(vide ante. p. <a href='#Page_93'>93</a>), cannot proceed, the inquiry may
be by Justices of the Peace, (who by their commissions
have a general power to inquire of all felonies,)
or in the King’s Bench, if the felony were committed
in the county where the court sits; and such inquisitions
are traversable by the executor, &amp;c. 1 <i>Hawk.
P. C.</i> <i>c.</i> 27, <i>s.</i> 12; 3 <i>Inst.</i> 55; <i>Hales P. C.</i> 29; 2
<i>Lev.</i> 141.</p>

<p class='c000'>Also all inquisitions of this offence being in the
nature of indictments, ought particularly and certainly
to set forth the circumstances of the fact; and
in conclusion add, that the party in such manner
murdered himself. 1 <i>Hawk. P. C.</i> <i>c.</i> 27, <i>s.</i> 13; 3
<i>Lev.</i> 140; 3 <i>Mod.</i> 100; 2 <i>Lev.</i> 152. Yet if it be full
in substance, the coroner may be served with a rule
to amend a defect in form. 1 <i>Sid.</i> 225, 259; 3 <i>Mod.</i>
101; 1 <i>Keb.</i> 907; 1 <i>Hawk. P. C.</i> <i>c.</i> 27, <i>s.</i> 15.</p>

<p class='c000'>If a person is unduly found <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">felo de se</span></i>; or on the
other hand found to be a lunatic, when in fact he was
not so, and therefore ought to have been found <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">felo
de se</span></i>; although a writ of <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">melius inquirendum</span></i> will not
be granted, yet the inquisition is traversable in the
King’s Bench. 3 <i>Mod.</i> 238.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>By the rubrick in the Common Prayer, before the
burial office, (confirmed by <i>Statute</i> 13 and 14, <i>Car.</i> 2,
<i>c.</i> 4) persons who have laid violent hands on themselves
shall not have that office used at their interment.
Yet the priest has no power of enquiry, or
even as it would appear of delay, in order to enquiry,
when a body (though it be of a notorious suicide)
is brought to his church for interment. “The
proper judges, whether persons who died by their
own hands were out of their senses” (and a fortiori
whether they did or not die by their own hands)
“are doubtless the coroner’s jury. The minister of
the parish hath no authority to be present at viewing
the body, or to summon or examine witnesses,
and therefore he is neither entitled nor able to judge
in the affair; but may well acquiesce in the public
determination, without making any private enquiry.
Indeed, were he to make one, the opinion
which he might form from thence could usually be
grounded only on common discourse, and bare
assertion. And it cannot be justifiable to act upon
these in contradiction to the decision of a jury,
after hearing witnesses upon oath. And though
there may be reason to suppose that the coroner’s
jury are frequently favourable in their judgment in
consideration of the circumstances of the deceased’s
family with respect to the forfeiture, and their
verdict is<a id='r90' /><a href='#f90' class='c011'><sup>[90]</sup></a> in its own nature traversable, yet the
burial may not be delayed,<a id='r91' /><a href='#f91' class='c011'><sup>[91]</sup></a> until that matter on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>trial shall finally be determined. But on acquittal
of the crime of self-murder by the coroner’s jury,
the body in that case not being demanded by the
law, it seemeth that a clergyman may and ought”
(we can safely add is compellable) “to admit that
body to christian burial.” 1 <i>Burn’s Ecc. Law</i>, <i>tit.

  <h2 id='c12' class='c008'>OF MURDER GENERALLY.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>There are so many various modes by which this
infamous and horrid crime may be perpetrated,
that it would be an almost endless task to enumerate
them. In a legal point of view it is <a id='sca'></a>scarcely necessary;
for wherever death ensues from illegal violence<a id='r92' /><a href='#f92' class='c011'><sup>[92]</sup></a>,
with malice <em>prepense</em>, it is felony; yet for the better
aid of medical investigation it is expedient to class
them under several heads.</p>

<p class='c000'>Sir <i>Matthew Hale</i>, in his pleas of the Crown, vol.
2, p. 431, enumerates several ways of killing.</p>

<p class='c000'>1. By exposing a sick or weak person or infant
unto the cold, to the intent to destroy him, 2 <i>Ed.</i> 3,
189, whereof he dieth.</p>

<p class='c000'>2. By laying an impotent person abroad, so that
he may be exposed to and receive mortal harm, as
laying an infant in an orchard, and covering it with
leaves, whereby a kite strikes it and kills it. 6 <i>Eliz.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>Compt. de Pace</i>; 24 <i>Dalton</i>, <i>cap.</i> 93, (new edit. 145.)<a id='r93' /><a href='#f93' class='c011'><sup>[93]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>3. By imprisoning a man so strictly that he dies,
and therefore where any dies in gaol, the coroner
ought to be sent for to enquire of the manner of his
death.</p>

<p class='c000'>4. By starving or famine.</p>

<p class='c000'>5. By wounding or blows.</p>

<p class='c000'>6. By poisoning.</p>

<p class='c000'>7. By laying noisome and poisonous filth at a
man’s door, to the intent by a poisonous air to poison
him. <i>Mr. Dalton</i>, <i>cap.</i> 93, out of <i>Mr. Cook’s</i> reading.<a id='r94' /><a href='#f94' class='c011'><sup>[94]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>8. By strangulation or suffocation.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>“<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Moriendi mille figuræ.</span></i>”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The two first of these modes frequently occur in
cases of infanticide, and to that head, which requires
separate consideration on account of its intricacy, we
shall therefore refer it. Adults can seldom, if ever,
be exposed to destruction in this manner; though,
as in —— <i>Brownrigg’s</i> case, and others of the same
class, it may constitute a part of the crime of murdering
children, even of an advanced age, by duress and
starvation; where it is by a combination of cruel
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>injuries, and not by one specific blow or wound,
that death is produced. These cases we shall include
under a general head, having first disposed of
those which require more specific notice.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>“<i>By imprisoning a man so strictly that he dies, and therefore where any dies in gaol<a id='r95' /><a href='#f95' class='c011'><sup>[95]</sup></a> the coroner ought to be sent for to enquire of the manner of his death.</i>”<a id='r96' /><a href='#f96' class='c011'><sup>[96]</sup></a></h3>

<p class='c014'>Death by duress of imprisonment was in all probability
a very frequent occurrence in the earlier periods
of our history, we know that it has often been
inflicted by the individual tyranny of the nobles on
their vassals; and we have every reason to suppose,
that even the keepers of our public prisons were not
free from the imputation of cruelty to their unfortunate
inmates; many have died by violence, more by
neglect; it was therefore a wise and humane precaution
that the circumstances of every death of a prisoner
should be made the subject of minute enquiry;
it is also desirable that such enquiry should be carried
on by persons of competent skill, and with every
possible and proper publicity. Our own times we
will hope are entirely free from the crime of premeditated
murder on the body of a prisoner; but we must
not allow our confidence in the modern improvements
of prison discipline to lull us into a false security
as to the conduct of gaolers and their underlings
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>many of these may be men of mild and humane disposition,
but as their daily occupation must tend to
blunt the finer feelings of humanity, it is well that
every charge of misconduct should be met by immediate
and rigorous enquiry. On this subject see <i>Rex</i>
v. <i>Huggins</i>, warden of the Fleet, 2 <i>Lord Raym.</i>
1578; 2 <i>Str.</i> 882; 9 <i>Harg. St. Tri.</i> 107; <i>Bambridge’s</i>
case, 9 <i>Harg. St. Tri.</i> 146, 151; <i>Acton’s</i>
case, 9 <i>Harg. St. Tri.</i> 182, 210, 218; see also the
several Parliamentary Reports on Coldbath-fields,
Ilchester, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c000'>“A gaoler, knowing a prisoner to be infected with
an epidemic<a id='r97' /><a href='#f97' class='c011'><sup>[97]</sup></a> distemper, confines another prisoner
against his will, in the same room with him, by
which he catches the infection, of which the gaoler
had notice, and the prisoner dies; this is a felonious
killing. <i>Stra.</i> 856; 9 <i>St. Tri.</i> 146. So, to confine a
prisoner in a low damp unwholesome room, not allowing
him the common conveniences which the decencies
of nature require, by which the habits of his
constitution are so affected as to produce a distemper
of which he dies; this also is felonious homicide.
<i>Stra.</i> 884; <i>Lord Raym.</i> 1578. For although the law
invests gaolers with all necessary powers for the interest
of the commonwealth, they are not to behave
with the least degree of wanton cruelty to their prisoners.
<i>O. B.</i> 1784, p. 1177; and these were deliberate
acts of cruelty, and enormous violations of the
trust the law reposeth in its ministers of justice.
<i>Forster</i>, 322.” See I <i>Hawk.</i> P. C. by <i>Leach</i>, p. 119.</p>

<p class='c000'>Previous to the researches of the celebrated <i>John
Howard</i>, (see his treatise on Prisons and Lazarettos)
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>our prisons appear to have been in a most disgraceful
state; they are now greatly improved, but something
may yet be done for their amelioration, more
particularly as affecting the health of the prisoners;
and this principally, by allowing the most unrestrained
medical inspection by disinterested practitioners,
who should be as much as possible unconnected
with local prejudices, or partialities; some of
the parliamentary regulations of madhouses might in
this respect be usefully extended to all places of confinement;
those who are not <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">sui juris</span></i> are ever entitled
to additional protection.<a id='r98' /><a href='#f98' class='c011'><sup>[98]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The best practical proof of improvement, in the
construction of our prisons, and in our prison discipline,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>is to be found in the disappearance of that
fatal pest, which was commonly called the gaol fever,
a disorder which, with something of retributive
justice, frequently extended its ravages to those,
whose proper vigilance might have prevented its generation.
At the assizes held at Oxford in 1577,<a id='r99' /><a href='#f99' class='c011'><sup>[99]</sup></a>
called the black assize, we learn from <i>Baker’s</i> Chronicle
(p. 353) that all who were present died within
forty hours: the Lord Chief Baron, the Sheriff, and
about three hundred more. <i>Lord Bacon</i> ascribed the
fatality to a disease brought into court by the prisoners,
and <i>Dr. Mead</i> entertained the same opinion;
nor was similar infection, though to a less extent,
an uncommon occurrence<a id='r100' /><a href='#f100' class='c011'><sup>[100]</sup></a>, see vol. 1, p. 125. The
ancient practice of strewing the court with aromatic
herbs and flowers, and presenting bouquets to the
Judges, is said to have derived its origin from the
idea of preventing infection: fresh air, still wanting
in our courts, would have proved a more powerful,
and not less agreeable prophylaitic.</p>

  <h3 class='c013'>BY WOUNDING, OR BLOWS.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c014'>In investigating the subject of Wounds, it will be
convenient to adopt, on the present occasion, the
usual classification of local injuries, viz. 1. <i>Incised
wounds</i>, or cuts; 2. <i>Punctures</i>, or such as are inflicted
by pointed instruments; 3. <i>Bruises</i>, injuries occasioned
by blunt instruments; 4. <i>Lacerations</i>, where
the integuments are torn, and 5. <i>Gun-shot wounds</i>;
upon each of which we shall offer a few observations,
and, in the first place, it may be remarked generally,
that no graduated scale of wounds, expressive of the
degree in which they are curable or dangerous, can
ever be constructed; in appreciating the probable
degree of danger that attends a wound other data
will be required for the solution of the problem than
those deduced from situation and extent, such as the
constitution and temperament, age, habits of life,
especially as they regard temperance and sobriety,
previous state of health, unnatural structure and
disposition of parts, and existing diseases of the
wounded individual; together with the temperature
of the season, and other extrinsic circumstances. As
a general rule for our guidance a division of wounds
into four classes has been suggested, viz. 1. <i>Absolutely
mortal.</i> 2. <i>Dangerous.</i> <a id='thr'></a>3. <i>Accidentally mortal.</i>
4. <i>Not mortal.</i> Every practitioner, however, must
be aware that death will occasionally supervene on
the slightest injury, and at other times that the patient
recovers in spite of the most serious and extensive
mischief; in proof of the former assertion, the author
may state that he has seen a case in which the extraction
of a tooth was followed by death in less than
forty-eight hours; and every experienced surgeon
must in the course of his practice have observed the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>slightest wound<a id='r101' /><a href='#f101' class='c011'><sup>[101]</sup></a> productive of alarming and even
fatal consequences; in illustration of the occasional
occurrence of a contrary result we may recal to the
recollection of the reader the extraordinary case<a id='r102' /><a href='#f102' class='c011'><sup>[102]</sup></a> of
Mr. <i>Thomas Tipple</i>, who recovered after an accident,
by which the shaft of a chaise had been forced through
the thorax! There have also been instances of the
recovery of persons whose brain has been wounded
to a considerable depth, of others shot through the
head; Dr. <i>Male</i> states that a pauper in Paris, some
years ago, used to receive charity in a piece of his
skull. In the second volume of the <cite>Medico-chirurgical
Transactions</cite>, we have a well attested case of a
bayonet wound in the heart not causing immediate
death. <i>Littre</i> has given us a report of a man who
inflicted upon himself no less than eighteen stabs in
the abdomen with a knife; and although some of them
did not penetrate beyond the parieties, yet others
wounded the contents; the symptoms which followed
are stated to have been very severe, but by judicious
treatment the patient recovered; seventeen months
afterwards, however, he threw himself into the street
from a three pair of stairs window, and was instantly
killed. On examining the body all the wounds were
found healed, and, with the exception of one, all the
cicatrices were firm and level; they were traced into
the intestines, where corresponding adhesions were
observed.<a id='r103' /><a href='#f103' class='c011'><sup>[103]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The surgical practitioner will, after such cases, be
cautious in his prognosis, and profit by the experience
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>of Hoffman, who says, “<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">In judicio de vulnerum lethalitate
ferendo multorum Medicorum fama et fortuna
periclitantur</span></i>.”<a id='r104' /><a href='#f104' class='c011'><sup>[104]</sup></a> Fortunately for the administration
of justice, that act of the Legislature, called “<i>the
Ellenborough act</i>,” relieves us from many of those embarrassments
under which the professional witness<a id='r105' /><a href='#f105' class='c011'><sup>[105]</sup></a>
must otherwise have laboured, and the surgeon will
appreciate the high importance and utility of the
law, by which wounding with an intent to kill is
deemed equally criminal, whether death be the result
or not. Still, however, the testimony of the medical
practitioner will always be important; indeed the
evil intent is often to be inferred, or disproved, by
the nature of the injury inflicted; as is so well illustrated
in the case of a man, who fractured the skull
of a boy with a stick, upon finding him in the act of
plundering his orchard; when it was clearly made
out in evidence, that a mere chastisement was only
intended, for the size of the stick was not such as to
have occasioned any fatal effect, had not the skull of
the unfortunate boy been unusually thin.</p>

<p class='c000'>If the surgeon is called upon to inspect a wound,
with a view to ascertain whether it produced death,
he should in the first instance, endeavour to examine
its nature and direction, so as to disturb as little as
possible the position in which the body was found;
the knife of the anatomist must afterwards explore its
more particular condition and relations, by a dissection,
for the performance of which we shall give
ample directions in a future chapter.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>The importance of examining the wound, so as not
to alter the position of the parts must be obvious
when we consider how necessary it may afterwards
become to compare as strictly as possible the internal
appearances with the external lesions. The direction
of a wound is frequently a circumstance of much
greater importance than may at first appear, we ought
not therefore to probe it without extreme caution,
lest we should give to it a direction which it did not
originally possess. This precaution becomes the more
necessary as the putrefactive process advances.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Of incised wounds, or cuts.</i> The prognosis of wounds
made with a cutting instrument varies, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">cæteris paribus</span></i>,
according to the extent and depth of the division, the
nature of the injured parts, and the circumstances
which attend the operation; where the instrument
has been so sharp as not to occasion any contusion or
laceration, the fibres and texture of the wounded part
will have suffered no other injury but their mere division;
and there is consequently less tendency to
inflammation, suppuration, gangrene, and other bad
consequences; if the wound be large and deep it will
be more dangerous, as well as more difficult to heal,
than one which only affects the skin. Wounds, accompanied
with injury of considerable vessels or
nerves, are more or less hazardous, according to the
magnitude or number of those vessels or nerves; generally
speaking, the most dangerous examples of
incised wounds are those which are made about the
throat; here there are so many large blood-vessels,
nerves and other parts of great importance, that deep
incised wounds often prove fatal, either immediately,
or in a few days; in some cases of suicide the carotid
artery is opened, and the person perishes from hemorrhage
on the spot, before any assistance can be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>afforded; in other instances he divides some of the
principal branches of the external carotid, and after
losing a great deal of blood, he faints, and the hemorrhage
being thus checked, the life of the patient
is preserved, until surgical assistance can be procured.
Cut wounds of the extremities, when such
arteries as the femoral and brachial are injured, may
also suddenly destroy the patient, by hemorrhage.<a id='foo'></a></p>

<p class='c000'><i>Punctures</i>, or such as are made by the thrust of
pointed weapons, as by swords, daggers, lances, and
bayonets, or by the accidental and forcible introduction
of considerable thorns, large nails, skewers, &amp;c.
into the flesh,<a id='r106' /><a href='#f106' class='c011'><sup>[106]</sup></a> comprise a class of wounds of great
importance and danger, as they generally penetrate
to a great depth, so as to injure large blood-vessels,
nerves, viscera, and other organs of importance; and
being inflicted with considerable violence the parts
always suffer more injury than what would be produced
by their simple division. It must also be considered,
that a great number of the weapons by which
such wounds are occasioned, increase materially in
diameter from the point towards their other extremity;
and hence, when they penetrate far, they must
force the fibres asunder like a wedge, and cause a
serious degree of stretching and contusion. It is this
circumstance which gives so dangerous a character to
bayonet wounds in the soft parts. The opening which
the point of such a weapon produces is quite insufficient
for the passage of the thicker part of it, which
can therefore only enter by forcibly dilating, stretching,
and otherwise injuring the fibres of the wounded
flesh. But mortal injury may be inflicted by an extremely
slender instrument, so as to occasion an apparently
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>trivial puncture; and in some cases, the
external injury is healed before the death, which it
occasions, takes place. Such cases can only receive
satisfactory elucidation from the lights of an anatomical
dissection, under which head we have furnished
several instructive examples.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Bruises</i>, or <i>Contusions</i>, strictly comprehend those
injuries which are occasioned by the violent application
of blunt or obtuse instruments to the soft parts.
They are not unfrequently complicated with severe
internal injury resulting from the violence which the
parts have sustained, such as inflammation, suppuration,
or even the rupture of some of the viscera, of
which we shall hereafter present several illustrative
cases.</p>

<p class='c000'>A blow on the region of the stomach sometimes occasions
instant death; an effect which would appear
to arise from an injury inflicted upon the eighth pair,
and great sympathetic nerves, by which the heart is
instantly paralysed. In these cases the heart has been
found empty, and the stomach has appeared red and
inflamed; this latter appearance is the obvious effect
of the sudden cessation of the heart, producing the
settling of the blood in the extreme arterial branches.</p>

<p class='c000'>Wounds of this description are, of course, more
or less important, according to their locality; unless
complicated with laceration, they are never attended
with any considerable hemorrhage, although the minute
vessels are necessarily ruptured, and the effusion
of their contents produces the discoloration so
characteristic of this kind of injury.</p>

<p class='c000'>As in the case of wounds, so also in respect of blows,
injuries apparently inadequate have produced death;
it then becomes difficult to fix the degree of guilt
which should be attached to the aggressor; for though
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>according to the strict letter of the law, every man is
responsible for the ultimate effect of an illegal act
committed by him; yet in moral justice there is much
difference between the atrocity of him who strikes a
grievous wound with a deadly weapon, from which
by chance his victim may recover; and the fault of
him who transported by sudden passion gives an ordinary
blow, which by accident, by reason of some
inward and unknown disease of his adversary, or by
injudicious treatment, becomes fatal. Numerous
cases might be cited in support of this position: that
of <i>Brain</i> for the murder of <i>Watts</i>, <i>Cro. Eliz.</i> 778:
<i>H. P. C.</i> 455. is one of the most remarkable, not only
from the circumstances attending the trial, where the
jury were fined and imprisoned for a corrupt verdict,
but also for the physiological circumstance, that the
deceased died instantly from a blow on the calf of
his leg. The parties had previously quarrelled and
fought; and <i>Brain</i>, the prisoner, was hurt; the next
day <i>Watts</i> passing his shop made mouths at him, on
which new provocation <i>Brain</i> hit him the blow which
instantly proved fatal. The Court held that the new
provocation was insufficient, and that the death must
be referred to precedent malice—might they not also
have considered that a blow on the calf of the leg was
more insufficient to produce death under ordinary
circumstances, than a wry face to induce or inflame a
quarrel? The prisoner was found guilty, but not
without considerable and as it appears to us proper
resistance on the part of the jury; the case being on
Appeal, the Crown could not pardon, though the appellant
might compromise his suit:—we are not informed
whether the prisoner was executed.</p>

<p class='c000'>A case, nearly parallel to the above, is that of
<i>Lydia Alder</i>, who was tried in 1744 for the murder
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>of her husband, whom she kicked on the groin; in
consequence of which, having at the time an inguinal
rupture, mortification came on, and he died. Verdict,
<i>Manslaughter</i>. The circumstances attending the case
of <i>Bartholomew Quain</i> were, in some respects, different;
he was tried and convicted for the murder of his
wife, at the Assizes for the Isle of Ely, in 1790. It
appeared in evidence, that a rupture of the spleen
was produced by the violent kicks, of which the indictment
stated that she had died. The jury, under
the direction of the Chief Judge of Ely, found a special
verdict, in order to take the opinion of the Court
of King’s Bench upon the following question, whether
the facts found by the jury amounted to murder, or
only to manslaughter, when the Court was clearly of
opinion that it was murder, because there did not appear
to have been any provocation on the part of the
deceased; and no man had a right, even to inflict
chastisement, without a just provocation.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Lacerations</i>, where the integuments are torn.—These
differ from incised wounds not only in the circumstance
of their being less disposed to heal by the
first intention, but in the singular fact of their not
bleeding to any extent; there are perhaps no facts,
in the history of surgery, more extraordinary than
those which have been recorded on the subject of
whole limbs being torn away, without hemorrhage.
The most remarkable of these is related by <i>Cheselden</i>,
in his work on Anatomy, being the case of a miller,
“whose arm, with the scapula, was torn off from his
body, by a rope winding round it, the other end being
fastened to the coggs of a mill; there was no hemorrhage,
nor did any severe symptoms supervene, so that
the wound was cured by superficial dressings only,
the natural skin being left almost sufficient to cover
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>it.” Analogous cases are recorded by <i>La Motte</i>, in
his <cite>Traité des Accouchemens</cite>; by Mr. <i>Carmichael</i>, in
the fifth volume of the <cite>Edinburgh Medical Commentaries</cite>;
and by others, in the second volume of the
<cite>Mem. de l’Acad. de Chirurgie</cite>. In appreciating the
degree of danger attendant upon wounds of this description,
the practitioner must not overlook the possible
occurence of Tetanus.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Gun-shot wounds.</i> Long after the invention of gunpowder,
Surgeons continued to entertain very vague
opinions respecting the nature of wounds produced
by it; some considered that the injured parts were
either dreadfully burnt by the heat of the projected
body, or were irritated by the presence of poison,
communicated to them by the powder. <i>Thomas Gale</i>,
who served as a Surgeon in the army of <i>Henry</i> 8th,
at Montreuil in 1554, was the first to refute the absurd
opinions of “the poisoning, burning, and conquassation
of gun-shot wounds.” A gun-shot wound is now
defined “a violent contusion, with, or without a solution
of continuity, suddenly and rapidly effected by
a solid body projected from fire-arms.” If a musket
or pistol ball has struck a fleshy part, without injuring
any material blood-vessel, we see a hole about the
size of, or smaller than the bullet itself; with a more
or less discoloured lip forced inwards, and if it has
passed through the parts, we find an everted edge,
and a more ragged, and larger orifice at the point of
its exit; the pain in this case is so inconsiderable that
the wounded person is frequently not aware of his
having received any injury. The course of balls is
frequently most extraordinary, and it behoves the judicial
surgeon to keep in mind a fact which may often
throw considerable light upon the subject of his investigation.
A ball will often strike the thorax or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>abdomen, and, to an inexperienced eye, appear to
have passed directly across, or to be lodged in one of
the cavities. If great difficulty of breathing or hemorrhage
from the mouth, with sudden paleness and
laborious pulse, in the one case, or deadly faintness,
coldness of the extremities, and the discharge of stercoraceous
matter from the wound, in the second, are
not present, we shall perhaps find that the ball has
coursed along under the integuments, and is marked
in its progress either by a redness, which Mr. <i>Hunter</i>
compared to a blush, or by a wheal, or dusky line,
terminated by a tumour, on the opening which it will
be easily extracted. In some of these long and circuitous
routes of balls, where we have not this mark,
a certain emphysematous crackling discovers their
course, and leads to their detection. The ball is in
many instances found very close to its point of entrance,
having nearly completed the circuit of the
body. In a case related by Dr. <i>Hennen</i>, as one that
occurred to a friend of his in the Mediterranean, the
ball, which struck about the <i>Pomum Adami</i>, was
found lying in the very orifice at which it had entered,
having gone completely round the neck, and
being prevented from passing out by the elasticity
and toughness of the skin which had confined it to
this circular course. This circuitous route is a very
frequent occurrence, particularly when balls strike
the ribs, or abdominal muscles, for they are turned
from the direct line by a very slight resistance indeed,
although they will at times run along a continued
surface, as the length of a bone, along a muscle,
or a fascia, to a very extraordinary distance. If there
is nothing to check its course, and if its momentum
be very great, it is surprising what a variety of parts
may be injured by a musket ball. Dr. <i>Hennen</i> states
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>that in one instance, which occurred in a soldier, who
having his arm extended in the act of endeavouring
to climb up a scaling ladder, had the centre of his
humerus pierced by a ball, which immediately passed
along the limb, and over the posterior part of the
thorax, coursed among the abdominal muscles, dipped
deep through the glutæi, and presented on the fore
part of the opposite thigh, about midway down. In
another case, a ball which struck the breast of a man
standing erect in the ranks lodged in the scrotum.
The propensity of balls to take a curved direction is
often seen in their course on a concave surface; in
short, they take very unusual and deep-seated routes,
not at all to be accounted for by any preconceived
theories drawn from the doctrine of projectiles, nor
to be explained by diagrams founded upon mathematical
rules. These considerations ought to render
the Surgeon very cautious how he delivers his opinion,
as to the direction in which the shot was fired,
and yet instances frequently occur where no difficulty
can arise upon this point, such was the case of <i>Richard
Annesley</i>, tried for the murder of <i>Thomas Eglestone</i>
(9 <i>Harg. Sta. Tri.</i> 327). The deceased was a poacher.
<i>Annesley</i> who was in company with the game-keeper,
stated in his defence, that his gun had accidentally
gone off in his attempt to secure the deceased. The
instructions given by the Court on this occasion was
that if the jury were of opinion that the gun had so
gone off accidentally, they should bring in a verdict
of <i>Chance-medley</i>, which was returned accordingly,
in consequence of the evidence of the Surgeon who
had examined the wound, and stated that its direction
being upwards, very satisfactorily proved that the
fowling-piece had not been levelled from the shoulder,
which would have implied design; but must have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>been discharged at the trail, which must have been
accidental.<a id='r107' /><a href='#f107' class='c011'><sup>[107]</sup></a> An idea long existed that a ball might
produce injury without striking any part of the body;
this was supposed by some to arise from the violent
commotion produced in the air by the rapid motion
of the ball; and by others, to depend upon an electrical
shock on the parts, in consequence of the ball
being rendered electrical by friction in the calibre of
the gun, and giving off the electrical matter as it
passes by. This, however, is contrary to all our
received notions respecting electricity; metals can
never acquire such a property by friction.</p>

<p class='c000'>In avowing our total disbelief in the existence of
such <em>wind-contusions</em>, as they have been called, we are
well aware that we shall oppose many very respectable
authorities. “<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Amicus Plato, sed magis amica Veritas.</span></i>”</p>

<p class='c000'>An important question, connected with the present
subject, still remains for elucidation; where a body
has been found dead with wounds and contusions, by
what signs we are to determine whether they were
inflicted during life, or after death. As the solution
of this interesting problem requires various data, its
consideration will be reserved for that part of our
work, where all the Objects of Inquiry, in cases of
sudden and mysterious death, are considered in their
various relations to each other, with a view to appreciate
their individual and joint importance.</p>

  <h3 class='c013'>BY POISONING.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c014'>No species of murder is so base and cowardly, or
so cool and deliberate in its perpetration as murder
by poison, which because of its secresy prevents all
precaution, whereas most open murder gives the
party killed some opportunity of defence;<a id='r108' /><a href='#f108' class='c011'><sup>[108]</sup></a> it is
generally committed in violation of domestic duty and
confidence, and too frequently evinces that unrelenting
and barbarous depravity, which can witness the
sufferings of its victim for days nay months unmoved;
therefore our ancient laws adjudged those convicted
of poisoning to a severer punishment than other offenders.
3 <i>Nels. Abr.</i> 363. <i>Jac. Law Dict. tit. Poison.</i>
By the 22 <i>Hen.</i> 8. it was <i>ex post facto</i> enacted that
<i>Richard Roose</i>, (or <i>Cooke</i>), for putting poison into a
pot of pottage in the Bishop of Rochester’s kitchen,
by which two persons were killed, should be boiled
to death; and that the offence in future should be
adjudged High Treason; but this among other new
treasons (with which the reign of <i>Henry</i> the 8th had
abounded) was abolished by the statute of <i>Edward</i> 6,
and now to poison any one wilfully is murder if the
party die in a year. 1 <i>Edw.</i> 6. <i>c.</i> 12.</p>

<p class='c000'>By the 43 <i>Geo.</i> 3. <i>c.</i> 58. (commonly called Lord
<i>Ellenborough’s</i> Act) any person administering poison
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>with <em>intent</em> to murder another, (though no death ensue)
or to procure the miscarriage of a woman quick
with child, is declared guilty of felony without benefit
of clergy: and persons administering medicines to
procure miscarriage, though the woman is not quick
with child, are declared guilty of felony, punishable
by imprisonment or transportation (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vide post</span></i>). If a
man persuade another to drink a poisonous liquor,
under the notion of a medicine, who afterwards drinks
it in his absence, or if <i>A</i>, intending to poison <i>B</i>, put
poison into a thing, and deliver it to <i>D</i> who knows
nothing of the matter, to be by him delivered to <i>B</i>,
and <i>D</i> innocently delivers it accordingly in the absence
of <i>A</i>;<a id='r109' /><a href='#f109' class='c011'><sup>[109]</sup></a> in this case the procurer of the felony
is as much a principal as if he had been present when it
was done (2 <i>Hawk. P. C.</i> 443: <i>Vin. Ab. tit. Accessory</i>)
or if one mix poison with any eatable with intent to
kill another, and a stranger casually eat it and die,<a id='r110' /><a href='#f110' class='c011'><sup>[110]</sup></a>
it is murder; <i>Dalton</i>, 93. <i>Agnes Gore’s</i> case for poisoning

not so if it be to kill vermin; but query if it be manslaughter
where there is not proper precaution, as
where the poison is laid in ordinary places for keeping
meat, and mixed with ordinary food, so that a
child may take it. 1 <i>East. P. C.</i> He that counsels
another to give poison, if that other doth it, the counsellor,
if absent, is accessory <em>before</em>. <i>Coke, P. C.</i> 49.
Case of the murder of Sir <i>Thomas Overbury</i>, <i>Harg.

poison, to the intent to poison, though he be absent
when it is taken by the party, yet he is principal, and
this was <i>Weston’s</i> case. <i>Harg. St. Trials</i>: <i>Co. P. C.</i>

<p class='c000'>It is not our intention to detail every mode by
which murder by poison may be committed; too
many are already known to the world in general; on
those which are known, we may safely comment; nor
would there be as much mischief as is commonly
supposed in hinting at some others; for if any should
study this subject with evil intention, he may be assured
that the progress of modern science, though it
may have discovered some new modes of destruction,
has been yet more fertile in antidotes for the injured,
and in means of detecting the guilty.</p>

  <h2 id='c13' class='c008'>OF POISONS,<br /> <br />CHEMICALLY, PHYSIOLOGICALLY, AND PATHOLOGICALLY CONSIDERED.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Toxicology, or the history of Poisons, forms one of
the most important and elaborate branches of Forensic
Medicine, and in tracing the subject through all its
numerous and interesting relations to Jurisprudence,
we shall experience no small degree of gratification
by observing, how greatly and progressively this obscure
department of science has, within the last few
years, been enlightened by the discoveries of Chemistry
and Physiology.</p>

<p class='c000'>The labours of the modern Chemist, indeed, have
enabled us to recognise and identify each particular
substance by its properties and habitudes, with an
infallible delicacy, which the Physicians of a former
age could scarcely have anticipated, and much less
practised.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Physiologist, by an invaluable series of observations
and experiments, has demonstrated the particular
organ, or texture, upon which each individual
poison exerts its energies; and the Pathologist has
been thus enabled to establish the mode in which it
depraves the health, or extinguishes the life of an
animal. Nor has the Anatomist withheld his contributions
upon this interesting occasion, for he has
demonstrated the situation, extent, and intensity of
the organic lesions which result from the operation
of these terrible agents upon the living body; and has
pointed out several appearances which occur from
natural causes, but which might be mistaken by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>unskilful or superficial observer, for the ravages of
poison. It remains for the Forensic Physician to converge
into one focus the scattered rays which have
thus emanated from so many points, and thereby to
elucidate and determine the line of conduct which
the medical attendant is called upon to pursue, for
the relief of the patient suffering under the torments
of poison, and for the establishment of the guilt or
innocence of the party charged with the perpetration
of a crime, which may be said to rob courage of its
just security, while it transfers to cowardice the
triumphs of valour. That engines so powerful and
secret in their work of destruction, should have
universally excited the terror of mankind is a fact
which cannot surprise us, and, when we consider how
intimate are the relations between fear and credulity,
we need not seek farther for the solution of the many
problems to which the exaggerated statements of
ancient Toxicologists<a id='r111' /><a href='#f111' class='c011'><sup>[111]</sup></a> have given origin; the most
extraordinary of those relate to the alleged subtlety
of certain poisons, which was believed to be so extreme
as to defeat the most skilful caution, and at
the same time so manageable, as to be capable of the
most accurate graduation; so that, in short, the
accomplished assassin was not only thus enabled
to ensure the death of his victim through the most
secret, and least suspicious agents, but to measure
his allotted moments with the nicest precision, and to
occasion his death at any period that might best
answer the objects of the assassination. The writings
of <i>Plutarch</i>, <i>Tacitus</i>, <i>Theophrastus</i>, <i>Quintillian</i>, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span><i>Livy</i>, abound with such instances of <em>occult</em> and <em>slow</em>
poisoning; most of which, however, notwithstanding
the weight they may acquire from their testimony,
bear internal evidence of their fallacious character.
<i>Plutarch</i> informs us that a slow poison which occasioned
heat, cough, spitting of blood, a lingering
consumption of the body, and a weakness of intellect,
was administered to <i>Aratus</i> of Sicyon. This same
poison is also alluded to by <i>Quintillian</i> in his declamations.
<i>Tacitus</i><a id='r112' /><a href='#f112' class='c011'><sup>[112]</sup></a> informs us that <i>Sejanus</i> caused
a <em>secret</em> poison to be administered by an eunuch to
<i>Drusus</i>, who in consequence gradually declined, as
if by a consumptive disorder, and at length died.
<i>Theophrastus</i><a id='r113' /><a href='#f113' class='c011'><sup>[113]</sup></a> speaks of a poison, prepared from
Aconite, that could be so modified as to occasion
death within a certain period, such as two, three, or
six months, a year, and even sometimes two years.</p>

<p class='c000'>To such an extent does the crime of poisoning appear
to have been carried, about two hundred years
before the Christian æra, that according to <i>Livy</i>,<a id='r114' /><a href='#f114' class='c011'><sup>[114]</sup></a>
above one hundred and fifty ladies, of the first families
in Rome, were convicted and punished for preparing
and distributing poison. The most notorious and expert
character of this kind is handed down to us by
the historians and poets under the name of <i>Locusta</i>,
who was condemned to die on account of her infamous
actions, but was saved in order that she might
become a state engine, and be numbered, as <i>Tacitus</i>
expresses it, “<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Inter instrumenta regni</span></i>.” She was accordingly
employed to poison <i>Claudius</i> by <i>Agrippina</i>,
who was desirous of destroying the Emperor, and yet
feared to despatch him suddenly, whence a slow poison
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>was prepared by <i>Locusta</i>, and served to him in a
dish of mushrooms, of which he was particularly fond,
“<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Boletorum appetentissimus</span></i>;” but it failed in its effects,
as we learn from <i>Tacitus</i>, until it was assisted
by one of a more powerful nature. “<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Post quem nihil
amplius edit.</span></i>” This same <i>Locusta</i> prepared also the
poison with which <i>Nero</i> despatched <i>Britannicus</i>, the
son of <i>Agrippina</i>, whom his father <i>Claudius</i> wished
to succeed him on the throne. This poison appears
to have proved too slow in its operation, and to have
occasioned only a dysentery. The Emperor accordingly
compelled her by blows and threats, to prepare
in his presence one of a more powerful nature,
and as the tale is related by <i>Suetonius</i>, it appears
that it was then tried on a kid, but as the animal
did not die until the lapse of five hours, she
boiled it for a longer period, when it became so
strong as instantaneously to kill a pig to which it was
given. In this state of concentration it is said to have
despatched <i>Britannicus</i> as soon as he tasted it.<a id='r115' /><a href='#f115' class='c011'><sup>[115]</sup></a>
Vide <i>Tac. An.</i> 13. <i>s.</i> 15. 16. Now it would clearly
appear from these statements that <i>Locusta</i>, avowedly
the most accomplished poisoner of ancient Rome, was
wholly incapable of graduating the strength of her
poisons to the different purposes for which they were
applied.</p>

<p class='c000'>The records of modern times will furnish examples
no less atrocious than those we have just related.
<i>Tophana</i>, a woman who resided first at Palermo, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>afterwards at Naples, may be considered as the <i>Locusta</i>
of modern history; she invented and sold those
drops so well known by the names of <i>Aqua Toffania</i>;
<i>Aqua della Toffana</i>; <i>Acquetta di Napoli</i>, or simply
<i>Acquetta</i>. This stygian liquor she distributed by way
of charity to such wives as wished for other husbands;
from four to six drops were sufficient to destroy a man,
and it was asserted that the dose could be so proportioned
as to operate within any given period.<a id='r116' /><a href='#f116' class='c011'><sup>[116]</sup></a>
It appears that in order to secure her poison from
examination, she vended it in small glass phials, inscribed,
“<i>Manna of Saint Nicolas Bari</i>,” and ornamented
the vessel with the image of the Saint. Having
been put to the rack she confessed that she had
destroyed upwards of six hundred persons, for which
she suffered death by strangulation in the year 1709<a id='r117' /><a href='#f117' class='c011'><sup>[117]</sup></a>.
In 1670 the art of secret poisoning excited very considerable
alarm in France; the <i>Marchioness de Brinvillier</i>,
a young woman of rank and great personal
beauty, having intrigued with, and subsequently married
an adventurer named <i>Saint Croix</i>, acquired from
him the secret of this diabolical act, and practised it
to an extent that had never before been equalled.
She poisoned her two brothers through the medium
of a dish at table. She also prepared poisoned biscuits,
and to try their strength she distributed them
herself to the poor at the Hotel Dieu. Her own
maid was likewise the subject of her experiments.
To her father she gave poisoned broth, which brought
on symptoms characteristic of those induced by corrosive
sublimate. Her brothers lingered during several
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>months under much suffering. The detection of
this wretch is said to have been brought about in the
following manner. <i>Saint Croix</i>, whenever engaged
in the preparation of his poisons, was accustomed to
protect himself from their dangerous fumes by wearing
a glass mask, which happening to fall off by accident,
he was found dead in his laboratory.<a id='r118' /><a href='#f118' class='c011'><sup>[118]</sup></a> A
casket directed to the Marchioness, with a desire that
in case of her death it might be destroyed unopened,
was found in his chamber, a circumstance which in
itself was sufficient to excite the curiosity and suspicion
of those into whose hands it fell. The casket
was accordingly examined, and the disclosure of its
contents at once developed the whole plot, and finally
led to the conviction of this French Medea, who after
a number of adventures and escapes, was at length
arrested and sent to Paris, where she was beheaded,
and then burnt, on the 11th of July, 1676. The practice
of poisoning, however, did not cease with her
execution, and it became necessary in 1679 to establish
a particular Court, for the detection and trial of
such offenders; which continued for some time to
exert its jurisdiction under the title of <span class='sc'>Chambre de
Poison</span>, or <span class='sc'>Chambre Ardente</span>.</p>

<p class='c000'>With respect to the secret modes in which poisons
have been supposed capable of acting, mankind have
ever betrayed the most extravagant credulity, of
which the numerous tales upon record afford ample
proof; such as that reported of <i>Parasapis</i> by <i>Plutarch</i>,
from <i>Ctesias</i>, in his life of <i>Artaxerxes</i>, who, it is said,
by anointing a knife on one side by poison, and therewith
dividing a bird, poisoned <i>Statira</i> with one half,
and with the other regaled herself in perfect security.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>We are also told of <i>Livia</i> who poisoned the figs on a
tree which her husband was in the habit of gathering
with his own hands. <i>Tissot</i> informs us that <i>John</i>,
king of Castille, was poisoned by a pair of boots prepared
by a Turk; <i>Henry</i> VI, by gloves<a id='r119' /><a href='#f119' class='c011'><sup>[119]</sup></a>; Pope
<i>Clement</i> VII, by the fumes of a taper<a id='r120' /><a href='#f120' class='c011'><sup>[120]</sup></a>; and our king
<i>John</i>, in a wassail bowl, contaminated by matter extracted
from a living toad. To these few instances
of credulity may be added the offer of the priest to
destroy queen <i>Elizabeth</i> by poisoning her saddle<a id='r121' /><a href='#f121' class='c011'><sup>[121]</sup></a>,
and the <i>Earl of Essex</i>, by anointing his chair.</p>

<p class='c000'>Incredible and absurd as these opinions now appear,
they continued until a late period to alarm
mankind, and to perplex and baffle judicial investigations;
even <i>Lord Bacon</i> in his charge against the
<i>Earl of Somerset</i> for the murder of <i>Sir Thomas Overbury</i>,
in the Tower, seemed to give credit to the
story of <i>Livia</i>, and he seriously stated, that “<i>Weston</i>
chased the poor prisoner with poison after poison;
poisoning salts, poisoning meats, poisoning sweetmeats,
poisoning medicines and vomits, until at last
his body was almost come, by the use of poisons, to
the state that <i>Mithridates’s</i> body was by the use of
treacle and preservatives, that the force of poisons
was blunted upon him;” <i>Weston</i> confessing, when he
was reproached for not despatching him, that he had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>given enough to poison twenty men.<a id='r122' /><a href='#f122' class='c011'><sup>[122]</sup></a> The power of
so graduating the force of a poison as to enable it to
operate at any given period seems to have been considered
possible by the earlier members of the Royal
Society, for we learn from <i>Spratt’s</i> history of that
learned body, that very shortly after its institution,
a series of questions were drawn up by the direction
of the Fellows, for the purpose of being submitted to
the Chinese and Indians, viz. “<i>Whether the Indians
can so prepare that stupifying herb, Datura, that they
make it lie several days, months, years, according as
they will have it, in a man’s body, without doing him
any hurt, and at the end kill him without missing half
an hour’s time?</i>”</p>

<p class='c000'>That mankind were, in a very early stage of their
existence, not only acquainted with the deadly effects
of certain natural substances when applied in minute
quantities, but that they availed themselves of such
knowledge for the accomplishment of the worst purposes,
is very satisfactorily shewn by the records of
sacred as well as profane authors. But such is the
ambiguity of ancient writers upon this subject, and so
intimately blended are all their receipts with the
practices of superstition, that every research, however
learned, into the exact nature of the poisons which
they employed, is necessarily vague and unsatisfactory.
Of this one fact, however, we may be perfectly
satisfied, that they were solely derived from the animal
and vegetable kingdoms, for the discovery of
mineral poisons was an event of later date; owing
however to the defect of botanical nomenclature, it
is even doubtful whether the plants which are designated
by the terms <i>Cicuta</i>, <i>Aconitum</i>, &amp;c. in ancient
authors, were identical with those we designate by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>the same names. (See <cite>Pharmacologia</cite>, edit. v. vol. 1,
p. 66.) With respect to the poisons of <i>Locusta</i>, all
cotemporary writers speak of the venom of the toad
as the fatal ingredient of her potions, and in the
Alexipharmaca of <i>Dioscorides</i> we find the symptoms
described, which are said to be produced by it;<a id='r123' /><a href='#f123' class='c011'><sup>[123]</sup></a>
but what is very extraordinary, the belief of the ancients
on this matter was all but universal. <i>Pliny</i> is
express on the subject; <i>Ætius</i> describes two kinds of
this reptile,<a id='r124' /><a href='#f124' class='c011'><sup>[124]</sup></a> the latter of which, as Dr. <i>Badham</i>
has suggested, was probably the frog, as well from
the epithet, as that he ascribes deleterious powers
only to the former. It is scarcely necessary to observe
that this ancient belief has descended into later
times; we find Sir <i>Thomas Browne</i> treating such an
opinion as one of the vulgar errors; and we have
before alluded to the legend of king <i>John</i> having been
poisoned by a wassail bowl in which matter extracted
from a living toad was said to have been infused.
In still later times, we have heard of a barrel of beer
poisoned by the same reptile having found its way
into it. <i>Borelli</i> and <i>Valisnieri</i> maintain that it is
perfectly harmless, and state that they had seen it
eaten with impunity. <i>Spielman</i><a id='r125' /><a href='#f125' class='c011'><sup>[125]</sup></a> expresses the
same opinion, “<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Minus recte itaque effectus venenati a
bufonibus metuuntur.</span></i>” <i>Franck</i>,<a id='r126' /><a href='#f126' class='c011'><sup>[126]</sup></a> on the contrary,
accuses <i>Gmelin</i> of too much precipitancy in rejecting
the belief respecting toad-poison,<a id='r127' /><a href='#f127' class='c011'><sup>[127]</sup></a> Modern naturalists
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>recognise no poisonous species of toad; even
the most formidable of the species, to appearance,
that of Surinam, is said to be perfectly harmless.</p>

<p class='c000'>If we may venture to offer a conjecture upon this
subject, we are inclined to consider the origin of this
opinion to have been derived from the frequency
with which the toad entered into the composition of
spells or charms, into philtres or love potions, and
which, like the bat and the owl, most probably derived
its magical character from the gloom and solitude
of its habitation. <i>Shakspeare</i> has accordingly
introduced this reptile into the witches’ enchanted
cauldron, in <i>Macbeth</i>.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Round about the cauldron go;</div>
      <div class='line'>In the poison’d entrails throw.</div>
      <div class='line'>Toad that under coldest stone</div>
      <div class='line'>Days and nights hast thirty-one</div>
      <div class='line'>Swelter’d venom sleeping got,</div>
      <div class='line'>Boil thou first i’ the charmed pot!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>This opinion receives further strength when it is
considered how frequently poisons were administered
under the insidious form of charms or incantations.<a id='r128' /><a href='#f128' class='c011'><sup>[128]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>It has, however, been shewn by late experiments
that the toad has, under particular circumstances,
the power of ejecting from the surface of the body an
acrid secretion which excoriates the hands of those
that come in contact with it; and this fact may perhaps
have assisted in supporting the general belief
respecting the poisonous nature of this reptile. <i>Pelletier</i>
has ascertained, that this corrosive matter, contained
in the vesicles which cover the skin of the
common toad, (<i>Rana Bufo</i>) has a yellow colour, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>an oily consistence, and to consist of,—1st, an acid
partly united to a base, and constituting 1/20th part of
the whole. 2d, very bitter fatty matter. 3d, an animal
matter bearing some analogy to gelatine.</p>

<p class='c000'>It would also appear from the writings of <i>Dioscorides</i>,
<i>Galen</i>, <i>Nicander</i>, <i>Ætius</i>, <i>Ælian</i>, and <i>Pliny</i>,
that the ancients derived a very energetic poison from
the Sea Hare, <i>Lepus Marinus</i>,—the <i>Aplysia Depilans</i>
of <i>Linnæus</i>; and, if we may credit <i>Philostratus</i>, it
was with such a poison that <i>Titus</i> was killed by
<i>Domitian</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>There is, however, ample ground for supposing
that the poisons of the ancients were, for the most
part, obtained from the vegetable kingdom, and from
the class of Narcotic plants;<a id='r129' /><a href='#f129' class='c011'><sup>[129]</sup></a> that they were compounded
of a great variety of such ingredients, together
with others that were quite inert and useless,
and which merely served to disguise their composition.</p>

<p class='c000'>Ancient writers also allude to the blood of the
bullock as a poison; <i>Themistocles</i> is said by <i>Plutarch</i>
to have destroyed himself by this fluid; and <i>Strabo</i>
states that <i>Midas</i> died of drinking the hot blood of
this animal, which he did, as <i>Plutarch</i> mentions, to
free himself from the numerous ill dreams which continually
tormented him. Some historians assign the
death of <i>Hannibal</i> to the same draught.</p>

<p class='c000'>With respect to the poisons employed by <i>Tophana</i>,
the Locusta of modern days, and her infamous successors,
there is less doubt; <i>Arsenic</i>, <i>Corrosive Sublimate</i>,
<i>Sugar of Lead</i>, and <i>Antimony</i>,<a id='r130' /><a href='#f130' class='c011'><sup>[130]</sup></a> were amongst the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>most powerful of their instruments of torture and
death. According to the declaration of the Emperor
<i>Charles</i> VII to his physician <i>Garelli</i>, the <i>Aqua Toffania</i>
was a solution of arsenic in <i>Aqua Cymbalariæ</i>.<a id='r131' /><a href='#f131' class='c011'><sup>[131]</sup></a>
Dr. <i>Hahneman</i> considered its basis to have been an
arsenical salt. Others have, with little probability,
regarded Opium and Cantharides as the active ingredients.
<i>Franck</i>,<a id='r132' /><a href='#f132' class='c011'><sup>[132]</sup></a> speaking of the <i>Aqua Toffania</i>,
agrees with <i>Gmelin</i>,<a id='r133' /><a href='#f133' class='c011'><sup>[133]</sup></a> that it is no other than a solution
of arsenic. The <i>Pulvis Successionis</i>, another
instrument of death, whose title announces the diabolical
intention with which it was administered, has
been supposed to have been a preparation of lead;
while others have considered it to have consisted of
diamond dust, and to have acted mechanically.</p>

<p class='c000'>Having thus noticed a few of the more remarkable
and interesting features in the literary history of
Toxicology, we shall proceed to consider the subject
of Poisons, in relation to their operation.</p>

<p class='c000'>A Poison, (<i>Toxicum</i>, <i>Venenum</i>, <i>Virus</i>), has been
very correctly defined by <i>Gmelin</i> to be a substance
which when administered internally, or applied externally,
in a small dose, impairs the health, or destroys
life. This definition is adopted by <i>Mead</i>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span><i>Sproegel</i>, <i>Plenck</i>, and <i>Tortosa</i>, and is to be preferred
to every other,<a id='r134' /><a href='#f134' class='c011'><sup>[134]</sup></a> not only for its simplicity, but for
its independence of any theory relative to the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">modus
operandi</span></i> of such agents. But it will be seen that, by
accepting this definition, we are necessarily led to
admit the fact, that poisoning may be acute, or chronic,
that is to say, that it may at once destroy life, or
produce a disease which can be protracted to any
indefinite period. After the erroneous and vague
notions which have been entertained upon the subject
of “<em>Slow poisons</em>,” it is highly essential that the latitude
of our belief should be accurately ascertained,
and the precise meaning of our terms defined.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>OF SLOW, CONSECUTIVE,<a id='r135' /><a href='#f135' class='c011'><sup>[135]</sup></a> AND ACCUMULATIVE POISONING.</h3>

<p class='c014'>1. <i>Slow Poisons.</i> According to the popular acceptation
of the term, they may be defined, <i>Substances
which can be administered imperceptibly; and a single
dose of which will operate so gradually, as to shorten
life like a lingering disease; their force, at the same
time, admitting of so nice an adjustment as to enable the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>artist to occasion death at any required period.</i> We
have now to inquire how far such alleged powers are
consistent with the known laws of physiology. It
cannot be denied that certain substances have been
introduced into the alimentary canal, where they have
remained for an indefinite period, without occasioning
the slightest inconvenience, and at length excited
a disease that has terminated fatally; in the <cite>London
Medical and Physical Journal</cite> for February 1816, a
case is related in which death was occasioned by a
chocolate-nut having lodged in the entrance of the
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Appendix Vermiformis</span></i>; and in the <cite>Edinburgh Medical
and Surgical Journal</cite> for July 1816, we have an
analogous case, communicated by Dr. <i>Briggs</i> of Liverpool,
where the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Appendix cæci</span></i> sphacelated, owing to
the irritation of a human tooth which was found sticking
in its cavity. Mr. <i>Children</i> has lately communicated
to the Royal Society a case where a concretion
in the colon produced death; upon examination it
was found to contain a plum-stone, as a nucleus, and
to consist of a fine fibrous vegetable substance, from
the inner coat enveloping the farina of the oat, and
which was derived from the oatmeal upon which the
deceased had fed. (<cite>Phil. Trans.</cite> 1822.) However disposed
we may feel, by a forced construction of the
term, to consider such agents as <em>slow</em> poisons, it is
very evident that they can rarely have been made
subservient to the purposes of secret poisoning; although
a case occurred in the practice of the author,<a id='r136' /><a href='#f136' class='c011'><sup>[136]</sup></a>
in which a girl swallowed six copper pence for
the avowed purpose of destroying herself; the coin
produced a disease which remained chronic for a very
considerable period, when, after a lapse of five years,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>they were voided, and the young woman recovered.
A similar attempt was also made by <i>Theodore Gardelle</i>,
after his conviction for the murder of Mrs. <i>King</i>
(<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vide ante</span></i>), he swallowed a number of halfpence, for
the purpose of destroying himself, but without any
ill effect. Dr. <i>Baillie</i>, in his ‘<cite>Morbid Anatomy</cite>,’ relates
an instance where five halfpence had been lodged
in a pouch in the stomach for a considerable time,
without occasioning any irritation; and Mr. <i>A. Thomson</i>
has also furnished us with two analogous cases in
children, in one of which the copper coin remained six
months in the intestines, and in the other, two months.
These facts furnish sufficient data to enable the practitioner
to appreciate the degree of danger attendant
upon such agents, and to determine how far they can
ever become successful instruments in the hands of
the assassin.<a id='r137' /><a href='#f137' class='c011'><sup>[137]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>But it has been supposed that certain bodies, as
glass, enamel, diamonds,<a id='r138' /><a href='#f138' class='c011'><sup>[138]</sup></a> agates, smalt, &amp;c. when
administered in the form of powder, so lacerate the
membranes of the stomach, by the sharpness of their
particles, as slowly to destroy life; and upon the
same principle, it has been asserted, that human hair,
chopped fine,<a id='r139' /><a href='#f139' class='c011'><sup>[139]</sup></a> constitutes the active ingredient of a
slow poison frequently employed in Turkey, and that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>it induces, by irritation, a chronic disease resembling
cancer. With respect to the danger arising from the
ingestion of diamond dust, enamel powder, powdered
glass, and the like, there still may be said to exist
some difference of opinion. <i>Caldani</i>, <i>Mandruzzato</i>,<a id='r140' /><a href='#f140' class='c011'><sup>[140]</sup></a>
and M. <i>Le Sauvage</i>, have reported experiments made
upon men and inferior animals, in which no bad consequences
followed the administration of such bodies;
whereas <i>Schurigius</i><a id='r141' /><a href='#f141' class='c011'><sup>[141]</sup></a> and <i>Cardanus</i><a id='r142' /><a href='#f142' class='c011'><sup>[142]</sup></a> cite instances
where persons have died of ulcerations of the stomach
from such causes; and this opinion receives the support
of <i>Plouquet</i>,<a id='r143' /><a href='#f143' class='c011'><sup>[143]</sup></a> <i>Stoll</i>,<a id='r144' /><a href='#f144' class='c011'><sup>[144]</sup></a> <i>Gmelin</i>,<a id='r145' /><a href='#f145' class='c011'><sup>[145]</sup></a> <i>Foderé</i>,<a id='r146' /><a href='#f146' class='c011'><sup>[146]</sup></a>
<i>Mahon</i>,<a id='r147' /><a href='#f147' class='c011'><sup>[147]</sup></a> <i>Franck</i>,<a id='r148' /><a href='#f148' class='c011'><sup>[148]</sup></a> and many others. The
modern pathologist will not find much difficulty
in reconciling such conflicting testimony. The experimentalist
may administer mechanical substances
a thousand times without producing any ill effects,
while, under certain circumstances, the most trivial
body may lodge in the intestines and produce death;
but surely the occasional occurrence of such accidents
ought not to confer the general title of <em>poison</em> upon
the substances which may happen to produce them.</p>

<p class='c010'>Having thus disposed of a considerable number of
bodies, which have been classed as <em>slow</em> poisons, we
may proceed to observe that most of the other substances
which have found a place in the same division,
appear to us to deserve consideration under a very
different head, and that we shall get rid of much obscurity
by adopting the following arrangement.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>2. <i>Consecutive Poisoning.</i> Where the patient, having
recovered from the acute effects occasioned by the
ingestion of a single dose of poison, <em>subsequently suffers
a series of symptoms from the injured structure to
which it had given origin</em>. By referring to our definition
of <em>slow</em> poisoning, we shall at once perceive the
striking and important distinction between that and
<em>Consecutive poisoning</em>. The following case, related
by M. <i>Orfila</i>, may serve as an illustration. <i>Maria
Ladan</i> drank by mistake a spoonful of <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Aqua fortis</span></i>,
the most violent symptoms supervened, but which
by judicious treatment gradually subsided, when at
length she passed by stool a long membranous substance,
rolled up, and which represented the form of
the æsophagus and stomach, and which, in fact, was
found to be the interior membrane of these organs;
from that moment the sensibility of the digestive
organs became excessive, and two months after the
accident she experienced a sudden shock and died.
M. <i>Tartra</i>, in observing upon cases of this kind, asserts
that the symptoms produced at first by the nitric
acid decrease insensibly; and that at the end of a
certain period, the internal membrane of the digestive
canal is struck with death, and thrown off, and the
person dies of a <i>Marasmus</i>. <i>Fordyce</i><a id='r149' /><a href='#f149' class='c011'><sup>[149]</sup></a> relates the
case of a woman who was subject to cholics for the
space of thirty years, in consequence of having <em>once</em>
taken an infusion of the pulp of Colocynth prepared
with beer. This was undoubtedly an extraordinary
instance of idiosyncrasy, but it is probable that some
organic lesion was occasioned by its operation, to
which the subsequent suffering is to be referred. We
have hitherto only considered the effects that may
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>arise from the ingestion of a <em>single</em> dose of poison, but
there are numerous and very interesting cases in which
fatal results have been produced by the repetition of
small doses at various intervals. We therefore propose
a third, and new subdivision of our subject, viz.</p>

<p class='c010'>3. <i>Accumulative Poisoning.</i>—By the repeated administration
of a substance, in doses, of which no
single one could occasion harm; but which, by gradually
accumulating in the system, ultimately occasions
disease, and death.</p>

<p class='c000'>The familiar operation of mercury will at once suggest
itself to the Physician, as a striking illustration
of that species of poisoning which we have ventured
to name <i>Accumulative</i>, and to the forensic student the
effects of this metal, in reference to such a quality,
will form a more than ordinary object of interest, as
involving questions which have frequently embarrassed
judicial inquiry; as, for instance, <em>Whether it
can lie dormant any considerable time without betraying
its effects upon the constitution</em>, and, having displayed
its powers, and the symptoms having subsided,
viz. salivation, &amp;c. <em>Whether they can be renewed without
a fresh application of the substance?</em> See Corrosive
sublimate.</p>

<p class='c000'>To how many substances this power of accumulation
extends is at present not well understood. It
may occur in those that act by absorption, and in
those whose action is wholly local. Arsenic, digitalis,
and several of the narcotic plants, as hemlock,
may undoubtedly occasion serious mischief in
this manner, as the author has more fully explained
in another work,<a id='r150' /><a href='#f150' class='c011'><sup>[150]</sup></a> and we have lately heard of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>several fatal cases arising from accumulated masses of
magnesia in the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">primæ viæ</span></i>, from the habitual use of
small doses of that earth.</p>

<p class='c000'>The history of many of the arts, especially those of
metallurgy, would furnish also abundant examples of
this kind of poisoning.</p>

<p class='c000'>These few facts are we trust sufficient to authorise
the foregoing arrangement, and we apprehend that
the adoption of the distinctions, upon which it is
founded, will be of great service in establishing fixed
and definite notions with regard to the <em>chronic</em> operation
of poisons. It may perhaps be useful to present
the reader with a synoptical recapitulation of the subject.</p>

<p class='c015'><i>A Slow Poison.</i> A single dose is sufficient; which
produces upon its administration no sensible effect,
but gradually undermines the health.</p>
<p class='c015'><i>A Consecutive Poison.</i> A single dose is sufficient; producing
the most violent symptoms, very shortly
after its ingestion, but which gradually subside,
and the patient is supposed cured; when, at some
future period, death takes place from the organic
lesions that had been occasioned.</p>
<p class='c015'><i>An Accumulative Poison.</i> Many doses are required;
the effects being produced by the repetition of
doses which would, <em>individually</em>, be harmless.</p>

<p class='c000'>There still remains another point of view in which
it is essential to regard the operation of a poison, in
order to establish a distinction between those substances
which, in a given dose, will destroy life under
every circumstance of constitution, and those which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>occasion death in consequence of some constitutional
peculiarity in the individual to whom they may have
been administered, and which are innocuous to the
general mass of mankind; the gradations by which
food, medicine, and poison, are thus enabled to
branch into each other cannot be defined, because the
circumstances with which they are related, defy generalization.
The distinction, however, must be acknowledged
and preserved, and we know no terms
better adapted for expressing it than those of <em>Absolute</em>
and <em>Relative</em> poisons; and our readers are accordingly
requested to receive them in conformity with this
explanation, whenever they occur in the following
pages. Every work professing to treat the subject
of Poisons, abounds with instances, in which articles
that, by universal consent, are considered innocuous,
have occasioned the most direful effects. <i>Morgagni</i>
relates a case of a person who died from eating
bread made with the farina of the chesnut. Dr. <i>Winterbottom</i><a id='r151' /><a href='#f151' class='c011'><sup>[151]</sup></a>
says that he is subject to severe nettle-rash
after eating sweet almonds. <i>Schenkius</i> relates a
case in which the general law of astringents and
cathartics was always reversed. <i>Donatus</i> tells us of
a boy whose jaws swelled, whose face broke out in
spots, and whose lips frothed, whenever he eat an
egg: we might add many more examples, but it is
needless to encumber a subject with illustrations
which is already so obvious and indisputable. Nor
do the anomalies of constitutional idiosyncrasies end
here, for they not only convert food into poison, but
they change poison into food, or at least, into a harmless
repast. The most extraordinary exemplification
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>of this on record is contained in the history of the old
man at Constantinople, as related by M. <i>Pouqueville</i>,
physician to the French army in Egypt, and who was
a prisoner at Constantinople in the year 1798<a id='r152' /><a href='#f152' class='c011'><sup>[152]</sup></a>. “This
man,” says he, “was well known all over Constantinople,
by the name of <i>Suleyman Yeyen</i>, or <i>Suleyman,
the taker of corrosive sublimate</i>. At the epoch when
I was there he was supposed to be nearly a hundred
years old, having lived under the Sultans <i>Achmet</i> III,
<i>Abdul Hamet</i>, and <i>Selim</i> III. He had in early life
habituated himself to taking opium; but, notwithstanding
that he constantly increased the dose, he
ceased to feel from it the desired effect, and then tried
sublimate, the effects of which he had heard highly
spoken of; for thirty years this old man never ceased
to take it daily, and the quantity he could now bear
exceeded a drachm. It is said, at this epoch he came
into the shop of a Jewish apothecary, and asked for
a drachm of sublimate, which he swallowed immediately,
having first mixed it in a glass of water. The
apothecary, terrified, and fearing that he should be
accused of poisoning a Turk, immediately shut up his
shop, reproaching himself bitterly with what he had
done; but his surprise was very great, when, the next
day, the Turk came again, and asked for a like dose
of sublimate.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Morbid states of the body may also exist which are
capable of resisting, to a certain extent, or of modifying,
the violent operation of particular poisons. In
the history of the Royal Academy of Sciences for 1703,
a case is related of a woman, who being tired out by
a protracted dropsy, under which her husband had
suffered, <em>charitably</em> administered to him fifteen or
twenty grains of opium with the intention of despatching
him; but the dose immediately produced such
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>copious evacuations by sweat and urine, that it restored
him to health. This relation will immediately
recal to the recollection of the classical reader the
story, recorded by <i>Plutarch</i>, in his life of <i>Crassus</i>, of
<i>Hyrodes</i> king of the Parthians, who having fallen
into a dropsical complaint had poison (<i>Aconite</i>) administered
to him by his second son, <i>Phraates</i>, but
which, instead of destroying the king, as intended,
cured his disease. The son, however, having thus
failed in his attempt, shortly afterwards smothered
his father with his pillow.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>
  <h2 class='c008'>GENERAL REMARKS<br /> <br />ON THE MEDICAL EVIDENCE REQUIRED TO SUBSTANTIATE AN ACCUSATION OF POISONING.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Although the phenomena by which we are enabled
to discover the administration of poison, will be fully
enumerated, and carefully examined, under the history
of each particular substance, and will necessarily
vary according to the chemical properties, and physiological
action of each individual poison; yet there
are some general points of evidence, and several
questions of importance, upon which it is very essential
to arrive at some definite conclusion, some fixed
understanding, before we proceed to the consideration
of the particular details, and subordinate ramifications,
of this complicated subject.</p>

<p class='c000'>The great constituents which form the medical
proof of poisoning, are derived from Chemical, Anatomical,
and Pathological researches; viz.—the existence
of poison in the stomach or intestines; the morbid
appearances, corresponding to such poison, upon
dissection; and the characteristic symptoms which
accompanied the action of it, previous to death.
Where these circumstances occur in combination, the
demonstration may be said to be complete, for we
have arrived at absolute certainty.</p>

<p class='c000'>But scientific evidence, short of such perfection,
may be amply sufficient to lead to conviction. The
fact of a poison having been found in the body may
supersede the necessity of pathological testimony:
thus <i>Hoffman</i>,<a id='r153' /><a href='#f153' class='c011'><sup>[153]</sup></a> “<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Si venenum adhuc intra ventriculum
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>reperitur, res est clarissima, ubi vero, illud haud
deprehenditur, res adhuc dubii plena est.</span></i>” We shall
hereafter find that the discovery of organic lesions,
without the chemical proof (“<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">experimentum crucis</span></i><a id='r154' /><a href='#f154' class='c011'><sup>[154]</sup></a>”)
is often vague, and seldom satisfactory, and
that even when sanctioned by the testimony of the
pathologist, will frequently be deemed insufficient to
sustain an indictment, unless indeed it be collaterally
supported by a very strong chain of circumstantial
evidence of a moral nature, especially such as relates
to the character, conduct, and presumed object
of the prisoner.</p>

<p class='c000'>As the duty of the medical witness, upon such occasions,
must always be anxious, and generally perplexing,
it becomes our duty at least to clear away
those adventitious difficulties with which ignorance
on the one hand, and sophistry on the other, have
obstructed a path of inquiry, which, from its very
nature and direction, must necessarily be obscure
and intricate.</p>

<p class='c000'>We shall endeavour upon this, as we have upon
similar occasions, to bring the more leading and popular
points of controversy within the scope of a few
prominent questions, assigning to each a share of attention,
commensurate with our idea of <a id='its'></a>its importance.</p>

<p class='c015'>Q. 1. <i>Whether all, or most of the symptoms, characteristic
of the action of corrosive and narcotic
poisons, may not arise from morbid causes of spontaneous
origin?</i></p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>Q. 2. <i>Whether organic lesions, similar to those produced
by poisoning, may not occasionally result
from natural causes?</i></p>
<p class='c015'>Q. 3. <i>Whether the rapid progress of putrefaction, in
the body generally, or in any particular part, is
to be considered as affording any presumptive evidence,
in favour of a suspicion of poisoning?</i></p>
<p class='c015'>Q. 4. <i>How far the absence of poison, or the inability
of the chemist to detect it, in the body, or in the
fluids ejected from it, is to be considered as a negative
to an accusation of poisoning?</i></p>
<p class='c015'>Q. 5. <i>What degree of information can be derived
from administering the contents of the stomach of
a person supposed to have been poisoned, to dogs,
or other inferior animals?</i></p>

<p class='c000'>We shall now consider these questions in succession.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>Q. 1. <i>Whether all, or most of the symptoms, characteristic of the action of corrosive and narcotic poisons, may not arise from morbid causes of spontaneous origin?</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>It must be admitted that the symptoms produced
by violent irritation in the primæ viæ, are not characterised
by a diversity, corresponding with that of
the causes which may excite it; thus it is, that we
have a disease to which the term “<i>cholera</i>” has been
assigned, and which is indicated by the following
symptoms, “<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Humoris biliosi vomitus, ejusdem simul
dejectio frequens; anxietas; tormina; surarum spasmata</span></i>,”
(Cullen Syn: <span class='fss'>LX.</span> 1.) symptoms which supervene,
and with nearly the same force, the spontaneous
effusion of acrid bile into the intestines, and the ingestion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>of some acrid poison; and hence the nosologist
has very properly divided <i>cholera</i> into two species,
viz.</p>

<p class='c000'>C. <i>Spontanea</i>, “Tempestate calida, sine causa
manifesta oboriens.”</p>

<p class='c000'>C. <i>Accidentalis</i>, “A rebus acribus ingestis.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The problem therefore for solution, is the mode of
distinguishing the two species from each other. Although
the leading characters are, as we have said,
the same in both, such as bilious vomiting, and purging,
violent tormina of the bowels, cold sweats,
cramps, faintings, and death, yet by a careful and
circumstantial examination of the case, the intelligent
practitioner will generally be enabled to arrive at a
probable conjecture; the season of the year<a id='r155' /><a href='#f155' class='c011'><sup>[155]</sup></a>, the
prevailing epidemics, the age<a id='r156' /><a href='#f156' class='c011'><sup>[156]</sup></a> and constitutional
predisposition of the patient, his habit with respect
to diet, are circumstances which will greatly assist
the diagnosis. The progress of cholera morbus is
also rarely, or never, fatal in this climate, especially
in so short a period as that in which death occurs
from the operation of a violent, corrosive poison.<a id='r157' /><a href='#f157' class='c011'><sup>[157]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>There are besides in this latter case, very frequently
other symptoms which do not attend <i>cholera spontanea</i>,<a id='r158' /><a href='#f158' class='c011'><sup>[158]</sup></a>
such as sanguineous vomiting, extreme burnings in
the æsophagus and region of the stomach, swollen
countenance, great dryness and tumefaction of the
fauces, peculiar fætor of the breath, ischuria, with
discharges of bloody urine, and ulcerations about the
fundament<a id='r159' /><a href='#f159' class='c011'><sup>[159]</sup></a>; this latter symptom was particularly
remarkable in the case of <i>Mr. Blandy</i>, whose history,
as related by his physician, <i>Dr. Addington</i>,
will be found in our <i>Appendix</i>, <i>p.</i> 236, and well deserves
the attentive consideration of the medical jurist.
The matter voided will also sometimes lead to a just
diagnosis; in the true cholera <i>spontanea</i> there is a
discharge of almost pure bile by vomiting and stool,
simultaneously or alternately; now, although the
same vomiting and purging may arise from the action
of a poison, yet it does not follow that the matter
discharged is bilious. The evidence delivered on the
extraordinary trial of <i>Donnall</i>, for the wilful murder
of his mother-in-law, <i>Mrs. Elizabeth Downing</i>, has
been also printed in the <i>Appendix</i>, as well illustrating
those doubts with which the present question is
naturally encompassed. An opinion has existed that
the appearance of jaundice during, or after the severe
symptoms of <i>cholera</i>, offers a satisfactory proof
of its spontaneous origin. Upon this point we would
observe, that by violent and protracted retching a
person may sometimes become jaundiced, a circumstance
not unlikely to occur in cases of poisoning.
The stomach, diaphragm, and abdominal muscles
are, under such repeated efforts, very apt to be rendered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>eminently irritable, so that at each effort of the
former to discharge its contents, the latter will frequently
be simultaneously thrown into strong spasmodic
contractions, and the liver, together with the
gall-bladder, will be suddenly caught, and, as it
were, tightly squeezed in a powerful press, in consequence
of which the bile will regurgitate, and be carried
into the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">venæ cavæ</span></i>; for <i>Haller</i> has shewn with
what facility a subtle injection, when thrown into
the hepatic duct, will escape by the hepatic veins;
upon which <i>Dr. Saunders</i> has made the following remark,
“I know this to be a fact, for I have ascertained
by experiment, that water, injected in the
same direction, will return by the veins in a full
stream, although very little force is used.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The fact of the bile becoming, under certain circumstances,
highly acrid and deleterious, has been
seized by the humoral pathologist as a powerful argument
in support of his doctrines. Amongst the
more distinguished authors who have fully treated
this subject, and maintained that our secretions may
thus become acrid poisons, we have <i>Galen</i><a id='r160' /><a href='#f160' class='c011'><sup>[160]</sup></a>, <i>Aretæus</i><a id='r161' /><a href='#f161' class='c011'><sup>[161]</sup></a>,
<i>Fernelius</i><a id='r162' /><a href='#f162' class='c011'><sup>[162]</sup></a>, <i>Morgagni</i><a id='r163' /><a href='#f163' class='c011'><sup>[163]</sup></a>, <i>Hebenstreit</i><a id='r164' /><a href='#f164' class='c011'><sup>[164]</sup></a>,
<i>Hilchen</i><a id='r165' /><a href='#f165' class='c011'><sup>[165]</sup></a>, <i>Hoffman</i><a id='r166' /><a href='#f166' class='c011'><sup>[166]</sup></a>, <i>Baumer</i><a id='r167' /><a href='#f167' class='c011'><sup>[167]</sup></a>, <i>Belloc</i><a id='r168' /><a href='#f168' class='c011'><sup>[168]</sup></a>,
<i>Alibert</i><a id='r169' /><a href='#f169' class='c011'><sup>[169]</sup></a>, <i>Foderé</i><a id='r170' /><a href='#f170' class='c011'><sup>[170]</sup></a>, <i>Mahon</i><a id='r171' /><a href='#f171' class='c011'><sup>[171]</sup></a>, <i>De la Mettrie</i><a id='r172' /><a href='#f172' class='c011'><sup>[172]</sup></a>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>and <i>Tronchin</i><a id='r173' /><a href='#f173' class='c011'><sup>[173]</sup></a>. Some of the authors above enumerated
have expressed their opinions in the strongest
terms; thus <i>Morgagni</i> (loco citato) “<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Facile agnosco
a prava ipsa corporis dispositione internum aliquando
posse venenum gigni</span></i>;” and <i>Hebenstreit</i> observes,
“<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Possunt omnino in corpore venena nasci,
atque ipsi humores vitales vim vasa sua destruendi sæpe
acquirunt.</span></i><a id='r174' /><a href='#f174' class='c011'><sup>[174]</sup></a>” <i>Hilchen</i>, after attempting to establish a
diagnosis between the effects of poison, and those
arising from a morbid degeneracy of the fluids, exclaims,
apparently in despair, “<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Inquilinos corruptosque
humani corporis humores, eum acrimoniæ gradum,
eamque corrodendi vim acquirere posse, quæ eosdem
edat effectus, quos venena corrosiva sistunt, eamdem
sordium vomitu rejectarum putrilaginem, fætorem,
haud dissimilem, et acerrimam, et pelves arrodentem
acrimoniam certum est.</span></i>” And <i>Plouquet</i>, after describing
all the phenomena of poisoning, concludes
by acknowledging “<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Probe autem notandum hæc omnia
etiam ex aliis statibus morbosis nasci posse.</span></i>”
<i>De la Mettrie</i> also has observed upon this question,
“<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Il est prouvé que la bile se peut changer dans
nos corps en espece d’Arsenic!</span></i>” Our own countryman,
<i>Dr. Currie</i><a id='r175' /><a href='#f175' class='c011'><sup>[175]</sup></a>, has furnished the public with
an opinion upon the subject under discussion, and he
states his belief that, under a peculiar state of irritation,
the biliary organs may secrete a bile of so very
acrid a nature as to excite an almost immediately fatal
impression upon the alimentary canal, especially
when suddenly effused, and in a highly concentrated
form.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>We have deemed it right to adduce these various
authorities, in relation to the important question before
us, still, however, reserving our opinion, that
the physician will on such occasions, by means of
the subsidiary sources of discrimination above enumerated,
generally be enabled to form a diagnosis<a id='r176' /><a href='#f176' class='c011'><sup>[176]</sup></a>
which, although it may not amount to certainty, must
be considered as capable of increasing the weight of
the general mass of circumstantial evidence.</p>

<p class='c000'>As the medical treatment to be adopted in cases of
acute disease, or poisoning, can hardly be considered
a subject of Medical Jurisprudence, we should have
passed it over in silence, did not the evidence delivered
upon the trial of Donnall imperiously call
upon us for some animadversion; and we feel it our
painful duty upon this occasion to observe, that the
whole tenor of the medical defence displayed a very
unbecoming contest; the witnesses conducted themselves
like advocates, raising doubts, and defending
their positions with a pertinacity that belongs to
those who seek triumph rather than truth.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the cure of cholera the experience of the physicians
of all ages wholly concurs. In the commencement
of the disease the evacuation of the redundant
bile is to be favoured by the plentiful exhibition of
mild diluents, and after the redundant bile has been
thus eliminated, or when the spasmodic affections of
the alimentary canal become dangerously violent,
opiates, in sufficiently large doses, but in small bulk,
may be administered. To employ evacuants, as <i>Sydenham</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>quaintly observes, “is to increase the disturbance,
and as it were, to endeavour to quench
fire by oil; and on the other hand, to commence
with opiates is shutting up the enemy in the bowels.”
Under such authority, we presume, one of the witnesses
in the defence of Donnall, felt justified in condemning
the practice of the respectable physician who
attended the deceased (<i>Appendix, p.</i> 304); but we
here see a witness assuming as a fact, what was never
proved in evidence, and then deducing conclusions
from it. <i>Dr. Edwards</i> informed the court that “there
were no symptoms of cholera morbus when <em>he</em> saw
Mrs. Downing; but from what <em>he</em> heard of her complaint,
he imagined that there was something offensive
either in the stomach or bowels, which ought to
be evacuated.” (<i>Ibid. p.</i> 286.)</p>

<p class='c000'>Nor are the symptoms produced by the operation
of narcotic poisons so distinct as to escape the possibility
of being confounded with those of spontaneous
disease. They may, for instance, simulate those of
apoplexy, or epilepsy; but the history of the case,
the odour of the breath, and the subsequent examination
of the body after death, will generally clear
up the difficulties which may at first present themselves.
But we shall have occasion to consider
this subject hereafter; the difficulties of the case
are well illustrated by the evidence on the trial
of <i>Donellan</i>, for the murder of <i>Sir Theodosius Boughton</i>,
with laurel water, for which see <i>Appendix,
p.</i> 243.</p>

<p class='c000'>Before we quit the subject which involves the consideration
of our fluids degenerating, under particular
circumstances, into poisons, we may just notice the
opinion of some foreign chemists, that in certain diseases
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>the <i>Prussic acid</i><a id='r177' /><a href='#f177' class='c011'><sup>[177]</sup></a> is generated in some of the
fluids of the animal body. We are not inclined to
accede to this proposition, because during life we do
not think the chemical decompositions, known to be
necessary for the production of this substance, can
ever take place. At all events, it must be preceded
by a state of the system which would necessarily prevent
the chance of any medico-judicial fallacy.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>Q. II. <i>Whether organic lesions, similar to those produced by poisoning, may not occasionally result from natural causes?</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>In entertaining this question, we are prepared to
meet with numerous <a id='all'></a>alleged difficulties; but as
many of them appear to have arisen, rather from the
ignorance or carelessness of the operator, than from
the natural obscurity of the subject itself, we are inclined
to hope that by getting rid of the former source
of fallacy, we shall be enabled to examine with
some satisfaction and advantage, those which, in a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>greater or less degree, will be liable to baffle the researches
of the more experienced anatomist.</p>

<p class='c000'>Such are the changes which an animal body undergoes
after death, that unless the anatomist be intimately
acquainted with their nature and extent, it is
impossible that he should be able to derive any safe
conclusions from his dissection; thus, said <i>Mr. John
Hunter</i>, we may see appearances which are natural,
and may suppose them to have arisen from disease;
we may see diseased parts, and suppose them to be in a
natural state, and we may suppose a circumstance to
have existed before death, which was, in reality, a
consequence of it; or we may imagine it to be a natural
change after death, when it was truly a disease
of the living body. It is not difficult, therefore, to
perceive, how a person in such a state of ignorance
must blunder, when he attempts to connect the appearances
in the dead body, with the symptoms that
were observed during life; and indeed it may be
safely asserted, that the great utility of anatomical inspections
depends upon the accuracy, judgment,
and sagacity with which such comparisons are made.
In our chapter, on the art of conducting dissections,
we have endeavoured to point out each fallacy which
is likely to present itself to the inexperienced anatomist,
we shall therefore confine ourselves, on the
present occasion, to the consideration of those points
whose obscurity must be admitted to belong intrinsically
to the subject, and to be wholly independent of
the ignorance or skill of the dissector.</p>

<p class='c000'>Amongst the signs of the action of poison on the
human body, disclosed by the light of dissection, the
separation of the villous coat of the stomach has been
generally considered the most certain criterion. <i>Hebenstreit</i>,
whose opinion has been adopted by <i>Mahon</i>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>and many other forensic physicians, has delivered his
unreserved judgment upon the question, in the following
emphatic sentence. “<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Præterea sola atque infallibilis
deglutiti veneni nota est, separata et veluti decorticata
simulque cruenta interna ventriculi tunica:
nam separatio ista supponit applicatam superficiei internæ
ventriculi materiam fervidam, igni similem, quæ
tunicam istam a substrata solvit vasculari nervea.</span></i>”<a id='r178' /><a href='#f178' class='c011'><sup>[178]</sup></a>
In opposition to such an opinion, it is our duty to
state that several cases stand recorded<a id='r179' /><a href='#f179' class='c011'><sup>[179]</sup></a> in which
the detachment of the villous coat of the stomach and
intestines has taken place, without the slightest
ground to suspect the administration of poison, while
many vegetable poisons destroy life without occasioning
any inflammation in the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">primæ viæ</span></i>, and consequently
leave no traces of disorganization. But
there still remains another source of fallacy connected
with the present question which demands a full and
impartial inquiry, viz. that the gastric juice, by its
action upon the dead stomach, can occasion such
changes in structure, as may be mistaken for the effects
of a corrosive poison; these changes are according
to circumstances liable to vary in every possible
degree of intensity, from the slight erosion of the
interior villous coat of the stomach, as displayed by
the smooth, thin, and more transparent condition
of that viscus, to the destruction of all its membranes,
and the production of large perforations in its great
extremity. This phenomenon, the nature of which
was first explained by <i>Mr. John Hunter</i><a id='r180' /><a href='#f180' class='c011'><sup>[180]</sup></a>, depends
upon the gastric juice, which the stomach secreted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>during life, becoming its solvent after death. Amongst
the endless proofs which the history of the animal
economy affords of that universal law by which chemical
and vital forces are wisely preserved in a state
of perpetual hostility, there is no illustration more
striking and satisfactory, than that which is furnished
by the phenomenon in question. If animals,
or parts of animals, while possessed of the living
principle, be taken into the stomach, they are not in
the least affected by the solvent powers of its juices;
thence it is that we so constantly find animals of various
kinds living in the stomach, or even being hatched
and bred there; but no sooner do these animals lose
the living principle, than they become subject to the
digestive powers of the stomach, and are accordingly
dissolved, and assimilated. If it were possible, says
<i>Mr. Hunter</i>, for a man’s hand to be introduced into
the stomach of a living animal, and kept there for
some considerable time, it would be found that the
dissolvent powers of the stomach could produce no
impression upon it; but if the same hand were separated
from the body, and introduced into the same
stomach, we should then find that this organ would
immediately act upon it. <i>Spallanzani</i>, with a patience
that almost wearies his readers, made many
attempts at dissolving the stomach by its own juice,
but succeeded satisfactorily in none; he proved, however,
two important facts, <em>first</em>, that the process of
digestion, or more correctly speaking, of solution,
continues after death; and <em>secondly</em>, that the stomach
itself is digestible. The truth of the first he demonstrated
by introducing food into the stomach, after he
had killed his animal; and that of the second, by
giving the stomach of one dog to be devoured by
another. The fact then is clearly established, that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>the stomach, after death, may be dissolved by its own
juice<a id='r181' /><a href='#f181' class='c011'><sup>[181]</sup></a>; and this may exist in its cavity, or be
retained in the vessels which had secreted it. It
remains for us then to examine the circumstances
under which it is likely to occur, and the appearance
by which it may be distinguished; and we may
here be allowed to observe with an ingenious writer,<a id='r182' /><a href='#f182' class='c011'><sup>[182]</sup></a>
that were these points merely of a speculative
nature, or were their decision a matter of mere curiosity,
it would be idle to consume so much valuable
time in their discussion; but when we remember that
they are questions upon which the medical practitioner
may be called upon to deliver a solemn opinion,
in order to determine the fate of a criminal,
they undoubtedly demand the highest attention of
those who profess to aid the administration of Justice,
by the lights of science. We have, therefore,
first to inquire into <em>the circumstances under which this
natural erosion of the stomach is known to take place</em>.
<i>Mr. John Hunter</i><a id='r183' /><a href='#f183' class='c011'><sup>[183]</sup></a> details the history of three examples,
in which the stomach was considerably perforated.
Two of the men had died shortly after having
their skulls fractured, and the third was a man
who had been hanged, so that in each of these cases
the person had been deprived of life by violence;
whence <i>Dr. Adams</i><a id='r184' /><a href='#f184' class='c011'><sup>[184]</sup></a> inferred, that <i>Mr. Hunter</i> limited
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>the action of the gastric juice on the stomach
to such as died from violent and sudden causes; and
many physiologists have, accordingly, supposed that
solution of the coats of the stomach never takes place,
except where the person has died suddenly; this,
however, is an inference, as <i>Mr. Burns</i><a id='r185' /><a href='#f185' class='c011'><sup>[185]</sup></a> has very
justly observed, “by no means warranted by the general
tenour of <i>Mr. Hunter’s</i> essay,” indeed he expressly
states, that “there are few dead bodies in
which the stomach is not, <em>at its great end</em>, in some
degree digested;” “and any one,” continues <i>Mr.
Hunter</i>, “who is acquainted with the art of dissection,
can easily trace the gradations from the smallest
to the greatest.” The consideration of the vast
importance of this fact, and frequent opportunities
of investigating the subject, induced <i>Mr. Burns</i> to
collect the observations which he had made during
the dissection of those bodies in which he found the
stomach digested; and these observations, he informs
us, have led him to conclude, that the phenomenon
in question is neither so rare in its occurrence
as some have imagined, nor confined to such subjects
as had been, previous to death, in a healthy condition;
they have also convinced him, that other parts
of the stomach, besides the large end, may be occasionally
acted on by the gastric juice. “That the digestion
of the coats of the stomach after death is not
a very rare occurrence, I think myself authorised to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>infer, from my having examined nine bodies in which
the solution had proceeded to such an extent as to
have made holes of considerable size through that
viscus; and, besides these nine instances in which
the digestion of part of the stomach was complete, I
have had occasion to see, in opening this viscus, various
degrees of dissolution of its villous coat.”<a id='r186' /><a href='#f186' class='c011'><sup>[186]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>In three of the instances alluded to by <i>Mr. Burns</i>,
the patients had been worn out by debilitating diseases;
and they were emaciated and anasarcous.
That the solution of the coats of the stomach in these
cases was properly attributed to the gastric juice is
very satisfactorily shewn by the relation of the following
instructive dissection. “I had occasion,”
says <i>Mr. Burns</i>, “two days after death, to open the
body of a very emaciated and anasarcous young girl,
who had died from scrofulous enlargement of the mesenteric
glands. On raising the coverings of the abdomen,
the stomach, which was empty, presented
itself to view, <em>with its front dissolved</em>.<a id='r187' /><a href='#f187' class='c011'><sup>[187]</sup></a> The aperture
was of an oblong shape, about two inches in its
long diameter, and an inch in its short, with tender,
flocculent, and pulpy edges. This I demonstrated to
the pupils attending my class; and I especially called
their attention to the fact, that the liver, which was
in contact with the hole, had no impression made on
it. Having proceeded thus far, I placed all the parts
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>as they had been, stitched up the abdomen, and laid
the body aside in a cold situation for two days. Then
I opened it again, in presence of the same gentlemen,
and we found that, now, <em>the liver, where it lay
over the dissolved part of the stomach, was pulpy; its
peritoneal coat was completely dissolved, and its substance
was tender to a considerable depth</em>. At this time
the other parts of the liver were equally solid as before,
and as yet every part of the subject was free
from putrefaction; <em>the posterior face of the stomach,
opposite to the hole, was dissolved, all except the peritoneal
coat, at least the internal coats were rendered
pulpy and glutinous; the peritoneal covering had become
spongy and more transparent than it ought to have
been</em>.” These facts, in addition to the many other
important conclusions to which they will give rise,
admonish us, that in judicial investigations into the
cause of dissolution of the coats of the stomach, <em>the
appearances will vary, according to the period after
death at which the body is examined</em>. But the most
satisfactory case which has been reported, in proof
that the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">post mortem</span></i> solution of the stomach may
occur after a lingering disease, is that just published
by <i>Dr. Haviland</i>,<a id='r188' /><a href='#f188' class='c011'><sup>[188]</sup></a> where the patient died of fever
after an illness of 22 days; when upon opening the
body about 12 hours after death, the following appearances
were noticed: “On raising the stomach
and examining the little omentum, we were surprised
by the appearance of a dark-coloured fluid, which
seemed to escape from the former viscus. A most
careful search was now made, and a large opening
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>was perceived in the stomach on the upper and back
part, near the cardia. The stomach was then detached,
with a portion of the œsophagus and duodenum,
when a large perforation of the diaphragm came
into view, in the muscular part, corresponding precisely
to, and communicating with, the hole in the
stomach; so that a portion of the contents of the latter
organ had escaped into the cavity of the chest.
This part of the diaphragm was next removed. A
careful examination of the other abdominal and thoracic
viscera did not lead to the detection of the
slightest diseased appearance. There was no where
the smallest evidence of previous inflammation, no
adhesions or ulcerations of any part of the viscera.
The fluid which had escaped appeared to be nothing
more than the contents of the stomach, of which the
wine and water<a id='r189' /><a href='#f189' class='c011'><sup>[189]</sup></a> formed a part, and probably gave
it its dark colour. The stomach, on being examined
after its removal from the body, afforded the following
observations. The mucous membrane appeared
to be more red and vascular than usual throughout
its whole extent, and, here and there, were small spots
of what seemed to be extravasated blood, lying below
the mucous coat—for these spots were not to be
washed off, nor to be removed by the edge of the
scalpel. There were two holes in the stomach, the
larger very near to the cardiac end of the small curvature,
and on the posterior surface: this was more
than an inch in length, and about half that breadth;
the other not far from the former, also on the posterior
surface, about the size of a sixpence. The edges
of these holes were smooth, well defined, and slightly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>elevated. The coats of the stomach were thin in
many other spots, and in one in particular nothing
was left but the peritoneum, the mucous and muscular
coats being entirely destroyed. The hole in the
diaphragm was through the muscular portion, where
it is of considerable thickness, and was large enough
to admit the end of the finger. There was no appearance
of ulceration or of pus adhering to the
edges of this perforation of the diaphragm.” We
have extracted a full account of this dissection, as
the case is in itself truly interesting. The symptoms
of the patient had been carefully watched, and no
pain, or uneasiness was ever heard of, throughout
the whole course of the disease, except in the head.</p>

<p class='c000'>The powers of the stomach, as it would appear
from the report, had suddenly revived at about twelve
hours before his death, for “he asked for food, and
swallowed a few spoonsfull of calves’-foot jelly with
apparent relish.” May we not then conclude by observing,
that the facts above related very satisfactorily
<a id='cor'></a>corroborate the truth of the corollary deduced by
<i>Mr. Burns</i>, “that the digestion of the coats of the
stomach may take place under two very different conditions
of the body; that although such solution is
most frequent in those who have been suddenly deprived
of life, when in full health, that it is not confined
to those alone, but does, under certain circumstances,
occur in those who have died from lingering
diseases.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Having then shewn under what circumstances the
phenomenon in question may take place, we shall
now proceed to describe more minutely the appearances
which it may assume, and <em>first, with respect to
the part of the stomach, more usually acted upon by the
gastric solvent</em>. <i>Mr. Hunter</i> thought, that digestion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>of the stomach after death was occasioned by that
portion of the gastric juice <em>contained in the cavity</em> of
the stomach; consequently it followed, as a fair inference
from this doctrine, that the coats of this viscus
will only be acted on at that part on which the
contents of the stomach rested. In <i>Mr. Hunter’s</i>
cases, the great end of the stomach, which in the
supine position of the body is the most depending
part of this viscus, was found to be chiefly affected;
a fact which tended to corroborate and support his
opinion, and to render his conjecture extremely probable.
Other anatomists, however, have discovered
instances of solution of other parts of the stomach
than the great end, indeed we have already described
such an instance in the case of the emaciated and
anasarcous girl examined by <i>Mr. Burns</i>, where the
situation of the aperture was different from what it
had been in any of <i>Mr. Hunter’s</i> cases. It was
seated <em>on the fore-part</em> of the stomach, about an inch
distant from the pylorus, and mid-way between the
smaller and greater curvatures of this viscus; at a
part of the stomach with which the gastric juice <em>could
not have come into contact</em>, as the body had constantly
been in the supine posture. “If then,” asks <i>Mr.
Burns</i>, “the stomach was not acted on by the fluid
contained in its cavity, how came it to be dissolved?”
To us we confess his solution of the problem appears
sensible and satisfactory. “We cannot, with propriety,
ascribe the digestion of the stomach, in every
case, to the gastric juice which has been <em>poured into
the cavity</em> of that viscus; we are more properly in
some instances to refer it to the action of the fluid
<em>retained in the vessels</em> which had secreted it.” If this
be admitted as a correct explanation of the fact, we
shall cease to have any difficulty in accounting for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>the dissolution of other parts of this viscus besides
the large end. We shall learn that the part acted on
must vary, according to the place of the stomach
where the gastric juice is retained in the apparatus
which secreted it, and thus we shall be enabled to
explain some cases, which, at present, seem to be in
opposition to the observation of <i>Mr. Hunter</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>With respect to the appearances, which such erosions
assume, some difference of opinion has also
unfortunately existed. <i>Mr. Hunter</i> has asserted
that “there are very few dead bodies, in which the
stomach is not, <em>at its great end</em>, in some degree digested;
and the anatomist,” says he, “who is acquainted
with dissections can easily trace the gradations
from the smallest to the greatest. To be sensible
of this effect, nothing more is necessary than to
compare the inner surface of the great end of the
stomach, with any other part of the inner surface;
what is sound will appear soft, spongy, and granulated,
and without distinct blood-vessels, opaque,
and thick, while the other will appear smooth, thin,
and more transparent, and the vessels will be seen
ramifying in its surface; and upon squeezing the
blood which they contain, from the larger to the
smaller branches, it will be found to pass out at the
digested ends of the vessels, and appear like drops
on the inner surface.” This condition, however, of
the vessels does not invariably accompany such solution.
In three of the subjects dissected by <i>Mr. Burns</i>,
there was no appearance of vessels ramifying on the
coats of the stomach. To account for the absence of
this vascular appearance several explanations have
been attempted; “but we are not,” says <i>Mr. Burns</i>,
“to regard the cause of this deviation from <i>Mr.
Hunter’s</i> description, as depending upon the particular
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>part of the stomach acted on in the different
cases; neither are we to imagine that the stage of the
process at which we examine the body will assist us
in this investigation; we are rather to obtain an explanation
of this fact, from contemplating the difference
of condition of the different individuals at the
time of death; the subjects, whose cases are detailed
by <i>Mr. Hunter</i>, were persons cut off by violence, in
the plenitude of health, their stomachs at the time
excited by the stimulus of food to vigorous action,
and the process of digestion at the instant of death
going on briskly, circumstances under which it is
reasonable to infer that all the blood-vessels would
be filled with blood, which it is evident, from the
nature of the causes depriving them of life, would be
detained in the veins. This being the state of his
subjects at the moment of death, we shall not wonder
that, when he afterwards opened the bodies, he
could squeeze the blood from the digested ends of the
vessels.” This is certainly an ingenious explanation,
and receives considerable support from the important
fact of the stomach presenting a very high degree of
vascularity, in cases of sudden death, as exemplified
by <i>Dr. Yelloly</i><a id='r190' /><a href='#f190' class='c011'><sup>[190]</sup></a> in his account of the appearances
found in the stomachs of several executed criminals
soon after they had undergone the sentence of the
law. So also has dissection disclosed the same phenomena,
in those cases where life has been suddenly
extinguished by a blow on the region of the stomach;
inflammation, in such instances, is necessarily out of
the question, for death is immediate; the red and
<a id='inf'></a>inflamed appearance therefore of the stomach can
alone be accounted for by regarding it as the effect of
the sudden cessation of the heart, producing an accumulation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>of the blood in the extreme arterial branches.
But what shall we say of <i>Dr. Haviland’s</i> case? so far
from the patient dying suddenly, and in the plenitude
of health, he expired after a lingering illness of three
weeks, and yet, upon dissection, the stomach was
found <em>highly vascular</em>. This is in direct opposition to
the theory of <i>Mr. Burns</i>, and, we must confess, is
not a little embarrassing. Where the gastric solution
has proceeded so far as to produce perforations
in its coats, <i>Mr. Hunter</i> states that, “the contents
of the stomach are generally found loose in the cavity
of the abdomen, about the spleen and diaphragm;
and that in many subjects this digestive power extends
much farther than through the stomach. I have often
found,” says he, “that after it had dissolved the stomach
at the usual place, the contents had come into
contact with the spleen and diaphragm, and had
partly dissolved the spleen, &amp;c.” With respect to
the appearance of the gastric perforations, <i>Mr.
Hunter</i> characterises them as having “their edges apparently
half dissolved, very much resembling that
kind of dissolution which fleshy parts undergo when
half digested in a living stomach, viz. pulpy, tender,
and ragged.”</p>

<p class='c000'>As certain corrosive poisons will occasionally produce
such organic lesions in the stomach, as lead to
perforations in its membranes, a question naturally
arises, <em>how are we to distinguish such disorganizations,
produced by causes acting during life, from those which
result from solution after death</em>? To this we may at
once return a general answer, that in a judicial investigation,
we ought not to attribute erosion of the
stomach to poison, except it be accompanied by evident
marks of previous inflammation and reaction, or
with gangrenous appearances; unless indeed the poisonous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>substance be found in the stomach, or the
symptoms, previous to death, be characteristic and
satisfactory. It has been stated that the edges of
the natural perforation are “pulpy, tender, and
ragged,” whereas those produced by the caustic action
of a poison will generally be found well defined,
and of the same thickness as any other part of the
stomach. But let it be remembered, that, after all,
it is upon the detection of poisonous matter in the
stomach, that the prudent physician will place his
great reliance. We have thus offered a review of the
different opinions which have been entertained upon
this important question, and in conclusion we may
observe, that there will necessarily exist in each particular
case, circumstances which no general views
can comprehend, and upon which the practitioner
must exercise his judgment and discretion. It is not
our intention at present to enter fully into the several
questions which were raised on the memorable trial
of <i>Charles Angus</i> for the murder of <i>Margaret Burns</i>,
but as we have already very frequently alluded to the
medical evidence delivered on this occasion, and as
we shall hereafter be called upon to notice some of its
more striking features, we have subjoined a report of
the trial, and of the unhappy and ill-conducted controversy
to which it has given origin.<a id='r191' /><a href='#f191' class='c011'><sup>[191]</sup></a> Whether
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>the holes in the stomach were the effects of corrosive
poison or of that solvent action after death, which
we have just endeavoured to explain, must remain a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>matter of doubt, for the erosion in this case was so
considerable, and the inflammation so slight, that it
is impossible to assert that they both depended on the
same cause.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>With respect to the possibility of confounding the
appearances of gangrene, in the stomach, with those
of putrefaction, some notice is necessary in this place;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>and we cannot better illustrate the subject, than by
introducing the marks of discrimination which are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>considered by <i>Mahon</i><a id='r192' /><a href='#f192' class='c011'><sup>[192]</sup></a> as decisive upon such occasions.
The spots in the stomach, resulting from putrefaction,
says he, may be distinguished from those
which have resulted from violent causes, during life,
in the following manner. If the stomach retain its
natural colour, and the spots are mixed with a red
hue, or the ulcers have pale, or bright red edges,
such have been the effect of some violent impression
upon the living membrane; whereas, on the contrary,
if the stomach be pale, livid, or green, and
exhibit spots of the same colour, but of rather a
deeper hue, we may safely conclude that they are the
genuine phenomena of putrefaction. See the interesting
account of the dissection of <i>William Mitchell</i>,
p. 191.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>
  <h3 class='c013'>Q. 3. <i>Whether the rapid progress of putrefaction, in the body, generally, or in any particular part, is to be considered as affording presumptive evidence, in support of an accusation of poisoning?</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c014'>There are few opinions more popular than that
which considers the speedy putrefaction of the body
as the universal and never failing consequence of poisoning.
To appreciate, however, the true value of
such an indication, and to avoid the fallacies with
which it is surrounded, it is essential to remember
that the body of a person dying suddenly, and in
what may be called full health, is very liable to run
rapidly into a state of decomposition. As far, however,
as our observations enable us to deduce any
conclusion, certain vegetable poisons appear to accelerate
such a change; for, very shortly after death,
the body, under such circumstances, will frequently
swell, become highly offensive, assume a black<a id='r193' /><a href='#f193' class='c011'><sup>[193]</sup></a>
appearance, and exhibit gangrenous spots on its surface.
No such appearances, however, it is said,
usually follow as the <em>specific</em> consequence of the fatal
operation of <em>mineral</em> poisons; <i>Dr. Jaeger</i> in an Inaugural
dissertation,<a id='r194' /><a href='#f194' class='c011'><sup>[194]</sup></a> which deserves to be better
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>known, states, as the result of numerous experiments,
that the putrefaction of animal bodies, poisoned by
arsenic, whether buried or not, does not appear to
be either unusually accelerated or retarded; and he
moreover found that the generation of infusory animals,
the production of larvæ and subterraneous vegetation,
in and about the bodies of poisoned animals,
took place as usual; and he remarked that
“the immediate contact of an arsenical solution
seemed, in several instances, to retard, in some degree,
the putrefaction of the part to which it was
applied in sufficient quantity.” In the extraordinary
case examined by <i>Metzger</i>, in which the largest
quantity of arsenic ever, perhaps, taken into the stomach,
was found after death, the body was not opened
until eighteen days after dissolution, and yet, says
the anatomist, “<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">cadaver, quod mireris, sine ullo fœtore
aut putredinis signo erat, ut et absque maculis lividis,
si digitorum apices excipias</span></i>.” A case is also related
by <i>Dr. Yelloly</i>,<a id='r195' /><a href='#f195' class='c011'><sup>[195]</sup></a> in which death was occasioned
by arsenic, but where not the slightest appearance
of putrefaction was visible at the time of
examination, which did not take place until forty-nine
hours after death.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the other hand, <i>Morgagni</i><a id='r196' /><a href='#f196' class='c011'><sup>[196]</sup></a> states that, on
dissecting a female who died from Arsenic, “<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">facies
corporis posterior, ne suris quidem et calcibus exceptis,
tota erat nigra</span></i>.” And in the interesting
case of <i>William Mitchell</i>, as hereafter related, the
appearance of the body appears to have indicated that
decomposition had proceeded with more than ordinary
celerity.</p>

<p class='c000'>The fact of accelerated, or retarded putrefaction,
therefore, cannot be received with any confidence as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>a collateral indication of poisoning. <i>Dr. Carson</i>,
however, in the trial of <i>Charles Angus</i>, adduced the
circumstance of its absence, as a negative proof that
the deceased had not been poisoned; and in the celebrated
Scotch trial of <i>Patrick Ogilvy</i>, and <i>Catharine
Nairne</i>,<a id='r197' /><a href='#f197' class='c011'><sup>[197]</sup></a> the same fact was forcibly urged in their
defence.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Gaspard à Reies</i>,<a id='r198' /><a href='#f198' class='c011'><sup>[198]</sup></a> and other writers, have maintained
that the discovery of <em>living</em> worms in the intestines
of a person, suspected to have died from poison,
ought to be received as a direct refutation of the
charge. We are, however, not disposed to concur
in such an opinion. With respect to the value of the
indication supposed to be afforded by the circumstance
of froth issuing from the mouth of the corpse, soon
after death, <i>Mr. Hunter</i> has given a very satisfactory
opinion, and to which we must refer the reader, see
<i>Appendix</i>, p. 273.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>Q. IV. <i>How far the absence of poison, or the inability of the chemist to detect it, in the body, or in the fluids ejected from it, is to be received as a negative to an accusation of poisoning?</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>We have already stated, that of all the proofs
which can be adduced by the physician, in support of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>a charge of murder by poison, no one can be put in
competition with that which arises from the discovery
of the poisonous substance itself, in the stomach, or
in the contents of the matter ejected by vomiting or
purging. The law expects, therefore, that the professional
witness should be prepared to state, that
every experiment, calculated to detect the presence
of poison, has been scrupulously and faithfully performed;
and we may take this occasion to observe,
that the circumstance of advanced putrefaction can
rarely, in the present state of our chemical knowledge,
be admitted as a satisfactory plea for not having
proceeded to an anatomical inspection, as preliminary
to chemical inquiry; and, as to the danger of
such dissections, <i>Dr. Gordon Smith</i> has very truly
observed, “that much is placed to this account which
belongs merely to disgust.” Had an examination of
the body taken place in the case of <i>Ogilvy</i> and <i>Nairne</i>,
how many doubts would have been cleared away;
indeed, this omission afforded the prisoners a strong
ground of defence; they complained that the informer
had intentionally prevented the dissection of
the body, being conscious that the suspicions he had
raised, and the project he had formed for their ruin,
would, by such a measure, have been totally removed
and defeated. To this it was answered, that when
the informer (a younger brother of the deceased) arrived,
he did insist on the body being opened and
examined, as soon as a physician of eminence could
be present, which the prisoners did not then oppose; but
that when the physician arrived on the ensuing day,
he declared the body to be in such a putrid state, that
no certain conclusions could be drawn from outward
appearances, nor even from a dissection of the body,
which, besides, could not be performed with safety
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>to the surgeon and attendants, and that he therefore
thought proper to decline the investigation. Fortunately
for the ends of justice, the circumstantial evidence
of guilt was too strong to be affected by this
culpable defect in the medical testimony, although
it has been often asserted that the prisoners should
have received the benefit of the omission by an acquittal.
See <i>Donellan’s</i> case in the <i>Appendix</i>, p. 243.</p>

<p class='c000'>With respect to the mode of conducting a chemical
analysis upon these occasions, we have reserved our
directions, until we shall enter on the discussion of
poisons individually. We have, however, in this
place some remarks of a general nature to offer, to
which we are desirous of drawing the attention of
those, who, without much experience, may be called
upon to conduct such investigations. In the first
place, we are desirous of convincing him, that the
processes which he must institute, for the detection
of a mineral body, are by no means so elaborate and
embarrassing, as a superficial view of the subject may
lead him to conclude. During the progress of the
present work the author has repeatedly felt the truth
of the opinion which he is now expressing; for, like
<i>Becher</i>, he has laid down his pen, and taken up his
tests, and, by the most simple modes of manipulation,
has satisfied his own mind of the extreme delicacy of
the different processes which are recommended for
the detection of a poisonous mineral; in short, it is
very difficult to convince those whose chemical knowledge
is wholly theoretical, with how little trouble,
and with how much pleasure and profit, such experiments
may be conducted. If such then be the perfect
state at which our analytical knowledge has arrived,
the reader may perhaps conclude, that <em>in every
case of mineral poisoning the deleterious substance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>should be found, and that the inability of the chemist to
detect its presence, should go far to negative the charge</em>.
Such an inference, however, is neither correct, nor
philosophical, for the poison may have been absorbed,
or eliminated, during life, it may have undergone
chemical changes, or it may have entered into combinations,
by which its characters are masked, or
wholly changed. To <i>Dr. Bostock</i> the judicial physician
is under many obligations, but there is no discovery
for which he is more deeply indebted to him,
than for that which has resulted from his satisfactory
experiments, in elucidation of the present question.
He has shewn, in the instance of <i>Corrosive Sublimate</i>,<a id='r199' /><a href='#f199' class='c011'><sup>[199]</sup></a>
that an animal may be suddenly killed by receiving
a metallic poison into the stomach, and yet that
the most delicate chemical re-agents may not be able
to detect any portion of such poison, after death, in
the contents of that viscus. <i>Dr. Henry</i>, in a letter
to <i>Dr. Duncan</i>,<a id='r200' /><a href='#f200' class='c011'><sup>[200]</sup></a> communicates the case of <i>Hannah
Tomlinson</i>, aged twenty, who died, under the care
of <i>Dr. Holme</i>, on the sixth day after a dose of
<i>Corrosive Sublimate</i>. In this case, although an
ounce of the mercurial salt had been swallowed, and
the fluid ejected from the stomach was examined,
only twelve hours afterwards, by <i>Drs. Henry</i> and
<i>Roget</i>, yet not the slightest trace of the poison could
be detected! More recently we have received from
the pen of <i>Mr. Alexander Murray</i>,<a id='r201' /><a href='#f201' class='c011'><sup>[201]</sup></a> surgeon of
Alford, some highly interesting cases of poisoning by
Arsenic, and which are so illustrative of the present
question, as well as several others that have fallen
under consideration, that no apology can be necessary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>for introducing some account of them in this
place. A family of the name of <i>Mitchell</i>, and which
consisted of <i>William</i>, a robust man, aged 45, <i>James</i>,
æt: 52, <i>Mary</i>, æt: 50, and <i>Helen</i>, æt: 48, breakfasted
together on Sunday morning, (August 19, 1821)
on porridge, consisting of milk, salt, and meal.
<i>William</i> partook largely, but <i>James</i>, who perceived
“a sickening taste,” took less than common, while
the sisters had their usual quantity. <i>William</i> was
seized with sickness shortly afterwards, about 10
<i>a. m.</i>, on his way to church, and then with thirst and
headache; and, on his return home, between three
and four in the afternoon, he was seized with vomiting,
which recurred often during the next four or
five days, especially on his attempting to quench his
thirst. In the early part of the week, he was heard
to complain of pain in his stomach, eyes, throat,
breast, and arms; he was observed to void his urine
frequently; and about this time, he pointed out to
one of his sisters a hollow<a id='r202' /><a href='#f202' class='c011'><sup>[202]</sup></a> between his breast and
belly, into which according to her expression, “she
could have laid her arm.”</p>

<p class='c000'>His illness had scarcely at any time confined him to
bed. On the evening of Friday, the 24th of August,
he rode six miles, for the purpose of consulting <i>Mr.
Murray</i>, the surgeon, and reporter of the cases; on
Wednesday the 22d he had taken a dose of Epsom
salts which operated, and at the time <i>Mr. Murray</i>
first saw him he complained of the following symptoms:—pain
and heat in the region of the stomach
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>and lower part of the chest; occasional uneasiness
in the abdomen, and sometimes ineffectual efforts to
go to stool; thirst; difficulty of breathing; heat and
uneasiness of throat, with hoarseness; soreness of
eyes, which had the common appearance of inflammation;
shifting pains in his extremities, particularly
the arms, which had not their usual strength; great
restlessness; anxious expression of countenance;
pulse frequent, 100-110, not strong.</p>

<p class='c000'>A blister was applied over the stomach and lower
part of the chest, and he took an opiate at bed time.
On the following day, (Saturday 25th) <i>Mr. Murray</i>
visited him at his own house, and found him nearly
as before, except that his countenance more strongly
exhibited a disturbed and anxious expression, and
the redness of the eyes, and the hoarseness were increased.
<i>Mr. Murray</i> also observed small roundish
white accuminated prominences, on the palate and
uvula, apparently as if the membrane covering the
palate bones and <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">velum pendulum</span></i>, was detached at the
parts by a whitish liquid. This day he took an ounce
of castor oil, which operated in the afternoon, his
illness was not observed to change during the evening,
and he retired at about eight o’clock to rest. At a
little past two in the morning, he rose in search of
water to drink, and on returning to bed he was heard
to utter a deep groan; after which he lay motionless
and quiet, and very soon was found to have expired.
The surgeon who saw the body, about 10 <i>a. m.</i>, states
that “<em>many bluish spots were observed on the inferior
extremities</em>.” <i>James</i>, <i>Mary</i>, and <i>Helen Mitchell</i> were
attacked the same forenoon with their brother
<i>William</i>, and with nearly similar symptoms; they
were all, however, fortunate enough to recover, although
a considerable period elapsed before their usual
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>strength returned, and in all of them a numbness of
the arms, or legs, occurred, together with a loss of
muscular power.</p>

<p class='c000'>The body of <i>William Mitchell</i> was, owing to particular
circumstances, not opened until the 29th of
August, (3 days 8 hours after death) when the following
appearances presented themselves. “The
face had a natural, composed appearance; and the
rigidity of the body did not appear to be different
from what is common. The right ear, and corresponding
side of the face, as well as the scalp, exhibited
a deep clay-blue colour. On the chest and
belly, several spots and streaks, some green, others
blue, were observed; and the back, upon which the
body lay, was from head to foot of a livid colour;
while several roundish spots, of a still deeper hue,
gave to the shoulders and neck a mottled appearance.
The penis was much swollen and red. The
scrotum also was enlarged, and of a dark blue colour.</p>

<p class='c000'>Upon opening the abdomen, the smell was not
unusually offensive, and its contents did not appear
to have undergone alteration after death, but several
ounces of a highly-coloured liquid were found in the
cavity. The surface of the jejunum and ilium presented
many purple spots, some of which were several
inches in circumference. The peritoneal surface
of the stomach, in a tract which extended from the
cardia, and occupied, for some distance downwards,
the whole circumference of that viscus, except the
small curvature, was of a clear, dark red colour;
and through this space dark lines, apparently veins,
were observed to ramify. This appearance, perhaps,
from 20 to 30 square inches in extent, was strongly
marked in contrast with the natural state of the inferior
extremity and small curvature. The substance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>connecting the stomach to the spleen, was, as well as
a small part of the transverse colon, of a red colour.
The spleen was gorged with blood; the liver healthy.
The duodenum, from a small distance below the pylorus,
almost to its inferior extremity, and round
nearly the whole intestine, was of a very dark purple
colour. Upon opening the stomach, the internal
surface of that part where the outward appearance,
already described, existed, was found of a bright
red colour, and over this lighter dots were thickly
scattered<a id='r203' /><a href='#f203' class='c011'><sup>[203]</sup></a>, making such an appearance as might
be produced by a red colour being dashed from a
painter’s pencil, upon a somewhat darker <em>ground</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'>The internal coats of the duodenum were very
dark coloured, with a slightly reddish hue, pulpy,
thickened, and easily separated from the peritoneal
covering, while in one roundish spot, of the size of a
crown piece, the villous and muscular coats were entirely
wanting. Red patches were observed on the
inner surface of the jejunum and ilium, the shape,
size, and situation of which were the same as those of
the appearances already noted as occurring on the
outside of these intestines. The stomach and duodenum
contained about a quart of a brown, semi-opaque,
thickish liquid; the jejunum and ilium were
empty, and coated with a yellow viscid matter. The
lungs and heart were quite healthy; but in the cavity
of the thorax were ten ounces of a reddish turbid
liquid, and about half that quantity in the pericardium.
The pharynx was of an <a id='unu'></a>unusually red colour.
The whole of the brain was healthy, and of
firm consistence.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span><i>Mr. Murray</i> concludes by stating that no part of
the salt and milk used on the sunday morning, was
to be found after he visited the family, and that although
the remainder of the meal, and also the contents
of <i>William Mitchell’s</i> stomach and duodenum
were examined by <i>Drs. Henderson</i> and <i>Fraser</i>, of
Aberdeen, as well as by <i>Mr. Craigie</i>, surgeon, who
assisted in the dissection, and <i>Mr. Alexander Murray</i>,
yet, “<em>no poisonous ingredient was detected in these
substances</em>.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The pathological and anatomical facts were, however,
in themselves, so striking and satisfactory, that
not the slightest doubt can exist as to the cause of
the sufferings and death of the deceased; while, as
<i>Mr. Murray</i> very justly states, the high probability,
arising from the separate symptoms of each individual,
is strengthened almost to certainty, by the simultaneous
occurrence of these in a whole family of four
persons; while no similar disease, indeed no epidemic
of any kind, prevailed at that time.</p>

<p class='c000'>We have only to add that the brother-in-law of this
family was, in October, 1821, tried before the Judiciary
Court at Aberdeen, for administering poison to
his four relations; when the testimony given by the
medical witnesses induced the judge and jury to consider
the abstract act of poisoning proved. The accused
afterwards confessed his guilt, and that he perpetrated
the crime by means of <em>Arsenic</em>, put among
the salt on the sunday morning on which the family
were taken ill.</p>

<p class='c000'>The public, and the profession, are greatly indebted
to <i>Mr. Alexander Murray</i> for the details of
this instructive case; and the patient attention and
judgment with which he conducted the investigation,
deserve the highest commendation, and afford an example
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>which we sincerely hope future practitioners
will endeavour to follow.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>Q. V. <i>What degree of information can be derived from administering the contents of the stomach of a person supposed to have been poisoned, to dogs, or other animals?</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>It has from time immemorial been generally believed,
that no proof of poisoning is more satisfactory
than that which is furnished by the effects produced
upon dogs, by their swallowing the contents of
the stomach of persons who are supposed to have died
from poison. Writers on Forensic medicine have,
however, adduced several objections to the validity
of such a test; some of which are undoubtedly worthy <a id='of'></a>of
consideration, while others are the deductions of a
theory which receives no support from experience.
In the first place it has been stated, that substances
poisonous to man, will not always occasion deleterious
effects upon animals<a id='r204' /><a href='#f204' class='c011'><sup>[204]</sup></a>; this, to a certain extent, is
undoubtedly true; some of the <i>Ruminantia</i> appear to
be less sensible to the operation of narcotic plants,
than carnivorous animals. <i>Aloes</i> are injurious to dogs
and foxes. Oxen are said to eat the <i>Philandria Palustris</i>,
which is pernicious to horses; but we are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>very much inclined to believe that a poison sufficiently
powerful to destroy the life of a man, would if
administered in the same state of concentration, destroy
that also of an inferior animal. It is in smaller
doses only that the difference in the action of such bodies
upon various animals becomes evident and appreciable.
This opinion is confirmed by numerous
experiments. <i>Mr. John Hunter</i>, in his evidence<a id='r205' /><a href='#f205' class='c011'><sup>[205]</sup></a>
on the trial of <i>Donellan</i>, in answer to the question,
whether any certain conclusion can be drawn respecting
the poisonous operation of a substance upon man,
from its effects upon an animal of the brute creation,
replied, “<i>As far as my experience goes, which is not
a very confined one, because I have poisoned some thousands
of animals, they are very nearly the same; opium,
for instance, will poison a dog similar to a man; arsenic
will have very near the same effect upon a dog, as
it would have, I take it for granted, upon a man; I
know something of the effects of them, and I believe
their operations will be nearly similar.</i>” If any farther
confirmation of this opinion were required, how extensively
and satisfactorily has it been afforded by
the late experiments of <i>M. Orfila</i>.<a id='r206' /><a href='#f206' class='c011'><sup>[206]</sup></a> <i>Mr. Hunter</i>
also, on the memorable trial above mentioned, explained
a source of fallacy which attends such experiments
upon animals; he is asked “whether there
are not many things which kill animals almost instantaneously,
that will have no detrimental or noxious
effect upon a human subject, such, for instance, as
spirits?” He replies that a great deal depends upon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>the manner of conducting the experiment, and that
by forcing an animal to drink, the liquor often passes
into the lungs. See <i>Appendix</i>, <i>p.</i> 272. <i>Orfila</i>, in
his valuable work on poisons, instituted a series of
experiments upon this subject, with the intention of
determining the value of an experiment so generally
accredited; from which he <a id='is'></a>is led to conclude, 1st.
That the practitioner should never attempt by force
to make an animal swallow the suspected substance,
nor should he put it into his food; for by such a proceeding
he would not only run the hazard of losing
the greatest part of it, because the animal would reject
it, but the food with which it is combined might
exert upon it some chemical action, or so envelope it
as to protect the coats of the stomach from its contact;
besides which it would, says he, happen, at
least six times in ten, that a part of it would flow
through the larynx into the lungs, and the animal
will die of Asphyxia. 2d. The best method that can
be employed, consists in detaching the œsophagus,
perforating it with a small hole, introducing into it a
glass funnel, and pouring the liquid into the stomach;
that being done, the œsophagus is to be tied
below the opening. It would, observes <i>M. Orfila</i>, be
imprudent to prefer to this method, the use of an
elastic gum tube adapted to a syringe, for many bite
the tube, pierce it with holes, and the fluid then
flows out of the mouth; besides which, syringes of
tin might decompose certain poisonous fluids. The obvious
objection to such a mode of administration is anticipated
by this laborious experimenter with much ingenuity.
It may be asserted, says he, that the animal
perished from the operation of tying the œsophagus,
and not from the action of the poison thus
introduced into the stomach, but such an objection
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>has no foundation in truth, for either the suspected
substance is in quantity sufficient to destroy the animal,
or it is not; in the first case death will take
place during the first forty-eight hours, and will be
preceded by symptoms more or less severe, a phenomenon
never observed in the simple ligature of the
œsophagus; in the second case, the experiment will
not be more conclusive, than if the œsophagus had
not been tied: and the author asserts, that the operation
of tying the œsophagus would not, of itself, produce
during the first forty-eight hours any other symptom
than a slight dejection, and that consequently all
other morbid phenomena that may be observed, upon
such trials, ought to be attributed to the poisonous
substance. To all this we reply, that we believe,
in the hands of <i>Orfila</i> who has made a thousand experiments,
that such results may be satisfactory, but
we feel no hesitation in declaring, that we should not
place the smallest reliance upon such an experiment
when conducted by a person unaccustomed to the
operations of experimental physiology. If there be
no other mode of employing an animal as a test for
poison, but by tying his œsophagus, we must, in a
judicial point of view, reject it altogether.</p>

<p class='c000'>But there still remains another source of fallacy
connected with these experiments, to which considerable
importance has been attached. It has been
said that the acrid humours ejected from the stomach
of a person labouring under a <em>spontaneous</em> disease,
may kill an animal. <i>Morgagni</i><a id='r207' /><a href='#f207' class='c011'><sup>[207]</sup></a> relates a very remarkable
instance, in illustration of this fact. A
child having died of a fever was opened, when a
quantity of green bile was found in the stomach,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>which changed the colour of the scalpel to violet;
having dipped the point of the knife into this bile,
two pigeons were wounded with it, and they soon
died in convulsions. The bile was then mixed with
some bread, and given to a cock, which also died in
the same manner. From this general view of the
subject before us, the forensic physician will be enabled
to appreciate its just value, and to apply the
indications it may furnish, in each particular case,
without the risk of error. In some instances such experiments
may prove nothing, in others they may afford
only equivocal results, but which may add something
to the general weight of circumstantial evidence;
while others, again, may furnish proofs so
unquestionable, as to leave no doubt upon the subject;
such was the case in the instance of <i>Michael
Whiting</i><a id='r208' /><a href='#f208' class='c011'><sup>[208]</sup></a>, who was convicted of administering corrosive
sublimate to his brothers-in-law, when it appeared
in evidence that a portion of the poisoned
dumpling was given to a sow, who in consequence
became sick, and remained ill for several days.</p>

<p class='c000'>We have now disposed of the several questions
connected with the subject of poisoning, which must
be regarded, in their forensic relations, as being of
the highest importance. In considering the subjects,
generally, there must necessarily remain doubts,
many of which will be considerably diminished, or
entirely removed, upon their application to particular
cases; still, however, the nature of medical evidence
upon such occasions must be frequently regarded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>as only sustaining high probabilities, and the
professional witness may exclaim with <i>Hoffman</i><a id='r209' /><a href='#f209' class='c011'><sup>[209]</sup></a>
“<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ardua sane provincia ei imponitur cui determinandæ
ejusmodi quæstiones exhibentur.</span></i>”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>
  <h2 class='c008'>ON THE CLASSIFICATION OF POISONS.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Poisonous substances have been very differently
arranged by different authors, each appearing to have
adopted a classification best suited to promote the
particular views and objects of his own pursuit;
thus, the botanist and chemist, engaged in the examination
of the physical characters by which poisons
may be individually distinguished and identified, have
very judiciously erected their system upon the basis
of natural history. The pathologist, whose leading
object is the investigation of the morbid effects which
follow the administration of these agents, with equal
propriety and justice prefers a classification deduced
from a generalization of the symptoms they are found
to occasion; while the physiologist, who seeks to ascertain
through what organs, and by what mechanism
they destroy life, may be reasonably expected to arrange
the different poisons under divisions corresponding
with the results of so interesting an inquiry.</p>

<p class='c000'>To meet the comprehensive views of the forensic
toxicologist, an arrangement would seem to be required,
that should at once embrace the several objects
which we have just enumerated; for the data
from which the proof of poisoning is to be inferred,
are, as we have often stated, highly complicated in
their relations. No such classification, however,
can be accomplished, and we are therefore compelled
to select one which may approach the nearest to our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>imaginary fabric. That which was proposed by <i>Fodéré</i>,<a id='r210' /><a href='#f210' class='c011'><sup>[210]</sup></a>
and adopted, with some trivial alteration in
the order of succession of the classes, by <i>Orfila</i>, in
his celebrated system of toxicology, although it has
many defects and some errors, nevertheless merits the
preference of the forensic physician; its basis is
strictly pathological, and yet it distributes the different
poisons, with some few and <a id='uni'></a>unimportant exceptions,
in an order corresponding with that of their
natural history.</p>

<p class='c000'>The first two classes, for instance, present us with
substances of a mineral origin; the third and fourth,
with those which are principally of a vegetable nature;
and the sixth, with objects chiefly belonging
to the animal kingdom. The importance of acknowledging
a division, which has a reference to the three
great kingdoms of Nature, is perhaps greater than
the reader may anticipate; for in enumerating the
various experiments to be instituted for the detection
of poisons, we are, by such an arrangement, enabled
to bring together a connected series of processes,
nearly allied to, intimately connected with, and in

<p class='c000'>The following is the arrangement of <i>Fodéré</i> as modified
by <i>Orfila</i>: viz. Cl. I, <i>Corrosive</i>, or <i>Escharotic

Such as corrode and burn the textures to which they
are applied. When internally administered they give
origin to the following symptoms: violent pain accompanied
with a sense of heat and burning in the
stomach, and throughout the whole extent of the alimentary
canal; frequent vomitings, often sanguineous,
and alternating with bloody diarrhœa, with or
without tenesmus; the pulse hard, small, frequent,
and at length imperceptible; an icy coldness of the
body; cold sweats; a great anxiety and oppression
at the præcordia; and hiccup. Sometimes the heat
of the skin is intense, the thirst inextinguishable,
and the unhappy patient is tormented with Dysuria
and Ischuria, violent cramps in the extremities, and
horrid convulsions, which are relieved only by death.
Such are the general symptoms by which this species
of poisoning is characterised; the rapidity with which
the symptoms terminate their course, will depend
upon the violence of the dose, and the particular
species of poison which has produced them; there
are, moreover, other symptoms which will be more
conveniently described, when we come to speak of
the effects of corrosive poisons individually. In this
class are ranked the following substances. <span class='sc'>Metals.</span>
I. Arsenic—1. <i>Arsenious Acid</i>, or white oxide of Arsenic.
2. <i>Arsenites</i>, or combinations of that acid with
<i>salifiable bases</i>. 3. <i>Arsenic Acid.</i> 4. <i>Arseniates</i>, or
combination of the preceding acid with the bases. 5.
<i>Sulphurets of Arsenic</i>, or <i>Orpiment</i> and <i>Realgar</i>.
II. Mercury—1. <i>Corrosive Sublimate of Mercury</i>, or
<i>Oxy-muriate of Mercury</i>. 2. <i>Red Oxide of Mercury.</i>
3. <i>Red Precipitate</i>, or <i>Nitric Oxide of Mercury</i>. 4.
Other preparations of Mercury. III. Antimony—1.
<i>Tartarized Antimony</i>, or <i>Tartar Emetic</i>. 2. <i>Oxide</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span><i>of Antimony.</i> 3. <i>Antimonial Wine.</i> 4. <i>Muriate of
Antimony</i>, or <i>Butter of Antimony</i>. IV. Copper—1.
<i>Blue Vitriol</i>, or <i>Sulphate of Copper</i>. 2. <i>Verdegris.</i>
3. <i>Oxide of Copper.</i> 4. Other preparations of Copper.
V. Tin—1. <i>Muriate of Tin.</i> VI. Zinc—1. <i>Sulphate
of Zinc</i>, or <i>White Vitriol</i>. 2. <i>Oxide of Zinc.</i> VII.
Silver—1. <i>Nitrate of Silver</i>, or <i>Lunar Caustic</i>. The
Concentrated Acids—1. <i>Sulphuric.</i> 2. <i>Muriatic.</i> 3.
<i>Nitric.</i> 4. <i>Phosphoric</i>, &amp;c. Hot Liquids—1. <i>Boiling
water.</i> 2. <i>Melted Lead.</i> The Caustic Alkalies—1.
<i>Potass.</i> 2. <i>Soda.</i> 3. <i>Ammonia.</i> The Caustic
Alkaline Earths—1. <i>Lime.</i> 2. <i>Baryta.</i> 3. <i>Muriate</i>,
and <i>Carbonate of Baryta</i>. Cantharides. Phosphorus.</p>

<p class='c000'>Class II. <span class='sc'>Astringent Poisons.</span> They occasion
a remarkable and unrelenting constriction of the
great intestines, especially the colon, so as to resist
the operation of the most powerful cathartic remedies.
Violent cholics ensue, and partial paralysis; in the
end if the dose be sufficiently large, or if small doses
have been frequently repeated, they will excite inflammation
of the alimentary canal, but it is not succeeded
by that disorganization which generally characterises
the operation of poisons, belonging to the
preceding division. We rank under the present class
only the preparations of Lead, viz. 1, <i>Acetate of
Lead</i>, or <i>Sugar of Lead</i>; 2, <i>Oxides of Lead</i>; <i>Red
Lead</i>; <i>Litharge</i>; 3, Various Saturnine impregnations.</p>

<p class='c000'>Class III. <span class='sc'>Acrid</span>, or <span class='sc'>Rubefacient Poisons</span>.
These poisons are known by their producing an acrid
taste, more or less pungent and bitter; a burning
heat, and considerable dryness in the mouth and
fauces; and a constriction, more or less painful, in
the throat. Acute pains are, after a short interval,
experienced in the stomach and bowels, which are
quickly followed by copious vomiting and purging,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>and which continue, with the most painful efforts,
long after the alimentary canal has been completely
evacuated. A few hours after, phenomena are observed
which indicate a lesion of the nervous system,
such as vertigo, dilated pupils, dejection, insensibility,
laborious respiration, and death. The
lesions of texture, occasioned by the action of <i>Acrid</i>
poisons, have the greatest analogy to those produced
by <i>Corrosive</i> poisons; in fact, says <i>M. Orfila</i>, “we do
not hesitate to declare, that there exists a perfect
identity between the alterations of the digestive canal
produced by the poisons of these two classes, when
introduced into the stomach.” The substances included
under this class belong, for the most part, to
the vegetable kingdom, such as <i>Scammony</i>, <i>Camboge</i>,
<i>Black</i> and <i>White Hellebore</i>, <i>Bryony</i>, <i>Euphorbium</i>,
Seeds of the <i>Ricinus</i>, <i>Iatropa Curcas</i> (Indian nut),
<i>Croton Tiglium</i>, <i>Squill</i>, <i>Aconite</i>, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c000'>Class IV. <span class='sc'>Narcotic</span>, or <span class='sc'>Stupefying Poisons</span>.
Such as occasion stupor, drowsiness, paralysis, or
apoplexy, and convulsions. They do not produce
any change in the structure of parts to which they are
applied. <i>M. Orfila</i> has satisfactorily ascertained that
no alteration can be discovered, on dissection, in the
digestive canal of persons who have swallowed any
one of the poisonous substances of this class.</p>

<p class='c000'>Class V. <span class='sc'>Narcotico-Acrid Poisons.</span> This division,
as its name implies, is intended to receive
such substances as produce the united effects of those
belonging to the two preceding classes, acting for
instance at the same time, as narcotics and rubefacients.
Amongst the articles of this class the following
may be enumerated, <i>Belladonna</i>, <i>Stramonium</i>,
<i>Tobacco</i>, <i>Foxglove</i>, <i>Hemlock</i>, <i>Nux Vomica</i>, <i>Camphor</i>,
<i>Cocculus Indicus</i>, certain <i>Mushrooms</i>, <i>Alcohol</i>,
&amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>Class VI. <span class='sc'>Septic</span> and <span class='sc'>Putrefying Poisons</span>.
By this term are included those poisons which, according
to <i>Orfila</i>, “occasion a general debility, dissolution
of the humours, and syncope, but which do
not, in general, alter the intellectual faculties.” The
articles of this class belong almost entirely to the animal
kingdom, with the exception perhaps of a few
gaseous compounds, and the <i>Spurred Rye</i>, or <i>Ergot</i>,
viz. <i>venomous animals</i>; <i>animals whose fluids have been
depraved by antecedent disease</i>; <i>the poison of fishes</i>;
<i>substances in a state of putridity</i>; <i>Spurred Rye</i>, or
<i>Ergot</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>Such is the classification which, for reasons already
stated, it is our intention to adopt on the present
occasion. We shall, however, in an additional
chapter, under the title of “<i>Aërial Poisons</i>,” treat
of those substances which are exclusively capable of
acting upon the body through the medium of the atmosphere,
or which require to be in a state of vapour,
or gas, to ensure their operation.</p>

<p class='c000'>With regard to the classification of <i>Fodéré</i> and <i>Orfila</i>,
we must here observe that we follow it only conventionally,
and that, while we acknowledge it as being very
convenient for the consideration of poisons, in reference
to their forensic relations, yet we must not be
considered as insensible to its many defects and fallacies.
In the first place, it has little or no reference
to the enlarged views of the modern physiologist, respecting
the “<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">modus operandi</span></i>” of poisons; nor indeed
is its construction susceptible of such modifications
and improvements, as can ever render its degree
of perfection progressive with the advancement of
science. In the next place, the classes are in many
particulars ill-defined, and indistinctly, if not erroneously,
divided. How questionable, for instance,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>are the boundaries which separate <i>Corrosive</i> from
<i>Acrid</i> poisons? even the respective species of each
class are, in many instances, less allied to each
other than the great divisions to which they are subordinate.
As an exemplification of this fact we have
only to compare the physiological actions of <i>Arsenic</i>
and <i>Corrosive Sublimate</i>; the former of these substances
occasions death by being absorbed, and thus
acting as a vital agent, the latter, by its local action
as a caustic on the textures with which it comes in
contact. In the same manner, if we examine the individual
actions of the different species composing the
class of “<i>Acrid</i>” poisons, we shall find the same
want of uniformity; thus the <i>Spurge-flax</i>, and the
<i>Jatropa Curcas</i> act by occasioning a local inflammation,
while the <i>Hellebore</i>, being rapidly absorbed,
exerts a fatal action on the nervous system, and produces
only a very slight inflammation. The class of
Narcotic poisons is more absolute in its definition,
and more uniform in its physiological affinities, and
therefore less objectionable, than the divisions to
which we have just alluded; but the propriety of the
term “<i>Narcotico-Acrid</i>” may be very reasonably
questioned;<a id='r211' /><a href='#f211' class='c011'><sup>[211]</sup></a> even <i>Orfila</i> expresses his doubts upon
the subject, “because the narcotic or sedative effects
only follow the previous excitement.” Some of the
poisons, under this last mentioned class, are rapidly
absorbed, and act, through the medium of the circulation,
on the nervous system, without producing
any local inflammation; whilst others, again, merely
act upon the extremities of the nerves, with which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>they come in contact, and without being absorbed,
occasion death by a species of sympathetic action.</p>

<p class='c000'>These few objections, and many more might be
adduced, are sufficient to demonstrate the imperfection
of the classification under consideration, and
which would render it wholly unavailable to the pathologist
who must adopt his treatment according to
the physiological action of each poison. The author
has accordingly, in his “Pharmacologia”<a id='r212' /><a href='#f212' class='c011'><sup>[212]</sup></a> ventured
to propose an arrangement, in conformity
with such views; and the following sketch of it may
perhaps form a useful introduction to the general observations
which it will be hereafter necessary to offer
upon the “<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">modus operandi</span></i>” of poisons.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>The preceding classification of poisons will not
only furnish the practitioner with a general theorem
for the administration of antidotes, but it will suggest
the different modes and forms of administration
of which each particular substance is susceptible; it
will shew, that certain poisons may occasion death
without coming into contact with any part of the alimentary
canal, and that others will produce little
or no effect, however extensively they may be applied
to an external surface. The first class comprehends
such poisons as operate, through the medium
of the nerves, upon the organs immediately subservient
to life; in the application of such agents it is
obvious that they cannot require to be introduced into
the stomach, they may convey their destructive influence
by an application to any part duly supplied
with nerves, and whose extremities are exposed to
their action; although at the same time, it may be
observed that, in general, poisons of this kind act
most powerfully when internally administered, owing
to the extensive sympathetic relations of this central
organ over every function of the living body. The
second class consists of poisons that are incapable of
producing any effect, except through the medium of
the circulation; whence we shall be enabled to explain
and appreciate the various circumstances which may
accelerate or retard their operation. Poisons of this
class may be applied externally to abraded parts, or
even to surfaces covered with cuticle, provided their
absorption be promoted by friction; and it may be
here observed, that the function of absorption is not
performed with the same force in every tissue; as a
general proposition it may be said to be energetic in
proportion to the number of lymphatics and veins,
although the late experiments of <i>M. Majendie</i> have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>shewn how greatly it is influenced by the state of the
circulation.<a id='r213' /><a href='#f213' class='c011'><sup>[213]</sup></a> If these poisons be administered internally,
they find their way into the circulating current
either through the branches of the thoracic duct, or
those of the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">venæ portarum</span></i>; when, as if by a species
of election, each substance very frequently expends
its venom upon some one particular system of organs.
Many of the substances arranged under this second
division, have moreover a local effect upon the structure
with which they first come in contact; it is thus
with <i>Colocynth</i>, and some other bodies; while on the
contrary, several of those poisons which are distinguished
for their <em>local action</em>, are subsequently absorbed,
and are thus as it were enabled to ensure
their work of destruction by a double mode of operation.
We shall receive ample evidence of this truth,
as we proceed in the history of particular poisons.
The third class comprises such agents as inflict their
vengeance upon the mucous membrane of the stomach,
by actual contact, and destroy, by exciting
local inflammation.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c008'><i>MINERAL POISONS.</i></h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'>Under this head is included the greater proportion
of those substances which are employed as the instruments
of crime; for they are generally of easy access,
require but little preparation, and are so destructive in
small doses, and, at the same time, so little disgusting
in flavour, as to furnish the assassin with the sure and
secret means of destruction. Fortunately, however,
for the ends of justice, such agents are pre-eminently
the objects of successful analysis. In treating of the
history of the individual substances derived from this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>kingdom, we shall consider, 1st. their <i>external characters</i>,
such as form, colour, odour, taste, specific gravity;
2d. their <i>chemical composition, and habitudes</i>;
3d. <i>the tests by which their presence may be recognised</i>;
<i>4th. the symptoms which they occasion</i>; <i>5th.
their physiological action</i>; <i>6th. their different modes
and forms of application</i>; <i>7th. the lesions of structure
they occasion</i>; <i>8th. the phenomena presented on dissection</i>.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>Cl. 1. CORROSIVE POISONS.</h3>
<h4 class='c016'>ARSENIC.</h4>

<p class='c014'>The greek <a id='wor'></a>word Αρσενικον was employed by <i>Dioscorides</i>,
and other writers of that period, to denote a
particular mineral of a reddish colour, which <i>Aristotle</i>
had already described by the name of σανδαρακη,<a id='r214' /><a href='#f214' class='c011'><sup>[214]</sup></a>
and his disciple <i>Theophrastus</i>, by that of αρρενικον.
It was employed by the ancients both as a pigment
and as a medicine, and appears to have been a compound
of Sulphur, and a peculiar metal, to which
the name of <i>Arsenic</i> is now exclusively applied. At
what period this metal was first discovered seems
very doubtful; and although a process for obtaining
it is described in the Pharmacopœia of <i>Schroeder</i>, published
in 1649, yet its peculiar nature was examined,
for the first time by <i>Brandt</i>, in 1733.</p>

<p class='c000'>The metal, Arsenic, is distinguished by the following
properties, viz.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>It has a bluish-grey colour, not unlike that of steel,
and a considerable lustre; its texture is grained, and
sometimes scaly; its hardness not very considerable,
but its fragility is so great that it falls to pieces under
a moderate blow of the hammer, and admits of being
easily reduced to a very fine powder; according to
<i>Bergman</i> its specific gravity is 8·31. When cold, it
emits no sensible odour, but if heated, it yields a
strong <i>alliaceous</i>, or garlic-like smell, which is to be
considered as the most characteristic of its properties.
Its point of fusion is unknown, for it is the most volatile
of all the metals, and sublimes, before it melts,
at the temperature of 540° Fah., and if the process be
conducted slowly in close vessels, the metallic sublimate
will assume a <a id='tet'></a><i>tetrahedral</i><a id='r215' /><a href='#f215' class='c011'><sup>[215]</sup></a> form of crystallization;
if the air be admitted, and the temperature
still farther raised, it will burn with an obscure
bluish flame.</p>

<p class='c000'>Arsenic is extremely susceptible of oxidation, and,
by mere exposure to the air, shortly loses its metallic
lustre; and yet it may be kept under the surface of
<em>cold</em> water, for any length of time without exhibiting
the signs of oxidation, or solution; a covering of
this fluid, or of alcohol, is therefore considered as
affording the best means of preserving the metal in a
state of integrity.</p>

<p class='c000'>Arsenic is capable of combining with two proportions
of oxygen, and of forming two definite compounds,
which we shall hereafter consider under the
title of <i>Arsenious</i> and <i>Arsenic</i> acids. The substance
described by some authors as the <i>black oxide</i> of this
metal would seem to be an indefinite mixture of the
metal itself, and the arsenious acid.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>Arsenic does not appear to possess any deleterious
properties, but it is almost impossible to reduce the
metal to powder, so as to adapt it for exhibition without
its becoming oxidized. <i>M. Renault</i> therefore, in
order to decide the question, had recourse to its alloys;
and he found that <i>Mispickel</i> (an alloy of Arsenic
and Iron), when given to the extent even of two
drachms, scarcely produced any effect; a result
which very satisfactorily accords with the conclusion
drawn by <i>Bayen</i>, in his work on Tin, and which
proves that the arsenic contained in that metal, need
not excite the least alarm, since it exists in a metallic
state. We have upon another occasion<a id='r216' /><a href='#f216' class='c011'><sup>[216]</sup></a> observed,
that the vapours characterised by an alliaceous odour
are probably less noxious than the arsenical fumes
which are inodorous; and that the little injury experienced
by workmen who solder silver filligree with
an arsenical alloy, may probably depend upon the deoxidized
state of its fumes.</p>

<h5 class='c016'>ARSENIOUS ACID, or WHITE OXIDE OF ARSENIC.</h5>

<p class='c014'>This is justly considered as the most fatal of all
mineral poisons, and is the one more frequently
selected than any other, as the instrument of assassination
and suicide; while its numerous applications
in medicine and the arts, by making it an article of
general and indiscriminate sale, have rendered it an
accidental as well as criminal source of suffering and
death.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is seldom prepared by the chemist, since it exists
in a native state, and is moreover procured abundantly
and economically, during the extraction of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>other metals from their ores.<a id='r217' /><a href='#f217' class='c011'><sup>[217]</sup></a> In the commercial
world the substance is still known by the name of
<i>White Arsenic</i>; and continues to be expressed in popular
language, by the simple term <i>Arsenic</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>It generally occurs in the form of white compact
masses, opaque on their exterior surface; transparent,
and presenting a vitrified aspect in the interior. Its
taste is acrid and corrosive, but not to a degree corresponding
with its virulence. <i>Specific gravity</i> 3·7. When
reduced to powder it bears a strong resemblance to refined
sugar, for which it has sometimes been fatally
mistaken, and with which it has been often mingled for
criminal purposes. At the temperature of 383° <i>Fah.</i>
it is volatilized, and is capable of crystallizing in
tetrahedrons with truncated angles, or rather in octohedrons;
by a strong heat, in close vessels, it is vitrified
and becomes pellucid, and acquires the specific
gravity 5·000<a id='r218' /><a href='#f218' class='c011'><sup>[218]</sup></a>; but when exposed to the air, it shortly
returns to its former appearance. <em>In the state of vapour
it is quite inodorous</em>, although the contrary is
positively asserted in several chemical works of high
authority, and it is stated to be characterised by a
smell like that of garlic; the fact is, that the <em>alliaceous
or garlic-like smell is wholly confined to metallic
arsenic in a state of vapour</em>; and whenever the arsenious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>acid seems to yield such an odour, we may very
confidently conclude that its decomposition has taken
place, and that it has been reduced to its <em>metallic</em>
state. Such a reduction will generally happen when
it is projected upon ignited charcoal, or when heated
in contact with those metallic bodies which readily
unite with oxygen, such as <i>Antimony</i>, <i>Zinc</i>, &amp;c.
It is stated by <i>Orfila</i> and other writers, that if it be
projected upon heated copper the alliaceous odour is
evolved. This assertion is undoubtedly true, but
the fact requires to be explained with more precision,
or we may fall into an important error respecting it.
The author has shewn by several experiments, already
published in his <i>Pharmacologia</i>,<a id='r219' /><a href='#f219' class='c011'><sup>[219]</sup></a> that the phenomenon
takes place only when the copper is in a state
of ignition, at which temperature its affinity for oxygen
enables it to reduce the arsenious acid, and consequently
to develope the metallic odour. We have
ascertained by repeated experiments that if a few
grains of arsenious acid be heated on a plate of copper,
by means of a spirit lamp or the blow-pipe, no
odour is perceptible; for, in this case, the whole of
the acid will be dissipated before the copper can
acquire a temperature sufficiently exalted to deoxidize,
and reduce it. If the arsenious acid be heated
on a plate of zinc, the smell will not be evolved
until the latter metal is in the state of fusion. If,
instead of the foregoing surfaces, we employ in our
experiments those of gold, silver, or platina, no alliaceous
smell whatever is produced, at any temperature,
provided every source of fallacy be carefully
avoided; but it deserves particular notice, that the
author has found the flame of the spirit lamp to be in
itself, capable of decomposing the arsenious acid, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>consequence, it is presumed, of the operation of its
hydrogen;<a id='r220' /><a href='#f220' class='c011'><sup>[220]</sup></a> a fact which is very likely to betray the
experimenter, as in the first instance it did the
author, into a belief that the arsenious acid does
actually yield the odour in question.</p>

<p class='c000'>The term Arsenious <em>acid</em> was first bestowed upon
this substance by <i>Fourcroy</i>, since it was found to possess
many of the essential habitudes of an acid; as
for instance, that of combining with the pure alkalies
to saturation. It dissolves in water; but, according
to <i>Klaproth</i>, although it requires for its solution 400
parts of that fluid, at the temperature of 60° <i>Fah.</i> it
requires not more than 13, at 212°; and it moreover
appears that if 100 parts of water be boiled on the arsenious
acid, and suffered to cool, it will retain 3
grains in solution, and deposit the remainder in
crystals. This fact shews the great importance
of employing boiling water in every chemical examination
of substances supposed to contain arsenic. It
proves also that a fatal dose of the poisonous mineral
may be very easily administered in any watery vehicle,
a fact which was denied on the trial of <i>Ogilvy</i>
and <i>Nairne</i><a id='r221' /><a href='#f221' class='c011'><sup>[221]</sup></a> by <i>Dr. James Scott</i>, who deposed that
“Arsenic would not dissolve in warm water, but almost
instantly subside to the bottom of the vessel,”
although, at the same time, he acknowledged that
“if it were put into tea with milk and sugar, and
stirred about, it <em>might</em> be suspended long enough to
kill those who should drink the potion.” It is soluble
in alcohol, and in fixed oils, the former taking up
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>two per cent. By the addition of an alkali, an <i>arsenite</i>
of great solubility will result, and a solution of
extreme virulence may be thus effected. With <i>lime-water</i>
arsenious acid produces a white precipitate of
<i>arsenite of lime</i>, but which is soluble in an excess of
the acid. With <i>magnesia</i> it also forms a very soluble,
and extremely active, <i>arsenite</i>.</p>

<h6 class='c016'><i>Symptoms of Poisoning by the Arsenious Acid.</i></h6>

<p class='c014'><i>Hahnemann</i>, in his work on Arsenic, proposes a
classification of its effects founded on their relative
duration and violence, and which it is our intention
to adopt on the present occasion, without any other
alteration than that of reversing the order of the
classes.</p>

<p class='c000'>Poisoning by Arsenic may accordingly be considered
as admitting of three degrees of intensity, viz. 1st.
Where the case, although attended with dangerous
symptoms, does not terminate fatally. 2d. Where
death does not follow until after a lapse of twenty-four
hours. 3d. Where death takes place within
twenty-four hours after the exhibition of the poison.</p>

<p class='c000'>1. <i>Symptoms of the first and lowest degree.</i> In the
slighter cases in which the operation of arsenic is recorded
as producing poisonous effects, the symptoms
were, uneasiness of the præcordia; cholics; thickness,
redness, and stiffness of the palpebræ; soreness of
the gums; ptyalism; itching over the surface of the
body, sometimes attended with a slight eruption;
restlessness; cough; head-ache; strangury, and <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ardor
urinæ</span></i>. Where the dose of poison has been somewhat
greater, although still inadequate to the destruction
of life, violent vomiting is commonly the
first symptom, preceded in some instances with a
sense of heat and dryness in the fauces; in such
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>cases where the vomiting has very shortly succeeded
the ingestion of the Arsenic, and the stomach has at
the same time been filled with food, the patient may
owe his escape to the poison being discharged before
it had time to act. <i>Morgagni</i> relates a case of poisoning
at an Italian feast, where the dessert was intentionally
sprinkled with Arsenic instead of flour;
those who had previously eaten but little speedily perished,
but those who had eaten heartily were saved
by vomiting. Although in this degree of poisoning
the life of the patient may be spared, yet a variety
of <em>consecutive</em> symptoms may continue to harrass
him for a longer or shorter period, such as indigestion,
debility, partial paralysis, and epilepsy. The
history<a id='r222' /><a href='#f222' class='c011'><sup>[222]</sup></a> of the cases of <i>Mr. Turner</i> and his family,
of Chancery lane, for the poisoning of whom <i>Eliza
Fenning</i> was executed, will afford a striking illustration
of this fact. The hair of the head has also been
<a id='obs'></a>observed, in some cases, to fall off. <i>Dr. Male</i> is also
of opinion that the long protracted and injudicious
use of this mineral, as a medicine, will induce exostosis
and caries of the bones.</p>

<p class='c000'>2. <i>Symptoms of the second degree.</i> In this case
where the patient lives two or three days, or perhaps
longer, as in the case of <i>William Mitchell</i> above described
(p. <a href='#Page_190'>190</a>), the earliest symptoms are heat and
thirst, or vomiting, and inexpressible uneasiness and
anxiety, the former of which is less frequently observed
than the two latter; purging, or sometimes a
repeated but ineffectual desire to go to stool; wandering
pains; quick, but feeble pulse; head-ache; distended
and painful abdomen; priapism; towards the
close of the scene the patient often becomes more tranquil
and is inclined to sleep, although, in some instances,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>the pains, attended with convulsions, continue
to the latest moments. In general, death takes place
suddenly. In cases where the effects of the poison are
not immediately fatal, we must necessarily expect
the occurrence of many phenomena, indicative of the
re-action of the system, and which will be better
illustrated by a reference to the history of individual
cases, such for instance, as those of <i>William Mitchell</i>,
(p. <a href='#Page_190'>190</a>) and <i>Mr. Blandy</i>, (<i>Appendix</i>) than by any
general description which can be given in this place.
It is also worthy remark that in such cases, from the
length of time, there will necessarily occur a greater
opportunity for the co-operation of other contingent
causes, whether they be connected with previously
existing diseases, or the action of remedies; and the
intelligent practitioner will not neglect to appreciate
their influence in modifying the character of each
particular case. There are besides symptoms highly
characteristic when they do arise, but which are of
comparatively rare occurrence, such as the ulcerated
condition of the fundament, as in the case of <i>Mr.
Blandy</i>, and the inflamed eyes and state of the mucous
membranes, in that of <i>William Mitchell</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>3. <i>Symptoms of the third and highest degree.</i> Soon
after a large dose of Arsenic has been swallowed, an
austere taste, and a sense of heat and constriction of
the pharynx and œsophagus are perceived; in a short
period excruciating pains in the stomach and bowels,
accompanied with vomiting of the most violent character,
the matter voided being generally of a brown
colour, and not unfrequently mixed with blood; with
these symptoms are conjoined an inexpressible anxiety
about the præcordia, and frequent faintings; the
stomach at the same time acquires such a high degree
of irritability, as to reject the mildest fluids.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>The alvine discharges now become frequent and painful,
and consist of dark and extremely fœtid matter,
frequently mixed with blood. The thirst is unquenchable,
and the heat of the surface becomes extreme.
The pulse is small, frequent, and irregular;
palpitations of the heart, violent cramps in the legs,
sometimes a painful strangury and bloody micturition
ensue. The powers of life begin to fail, respiration
becomes laborious, cold sweats break out,
hiccup occurs, the countenance assumes a singular
character of anxiety and distress, a livid circle appears
around the eyes, the pulse is imperceptible,
the body swells and sometimes becomes covered with
a species of miliary eruption, or with dark purple
spots. In some cases convulsions ensue, but delirium,
or loss of reason, is very rarely the consequence
of this species of poisoning, and the unfortunate
sufferer is conscious until a few moments before
the termination of his existence. Such are the general
symptoms, but it is rare to see them all united in
the same case; sometimes the greater part of them
are absent. <i>M. Chaussier</i> reports the case of a robust
middle aged man, who swallowed a quantity of
arsenious acid in large lumps, and died without discovering
any other symptom than slight syncope; other
cases are related where only vomiting and purging<a id='r223' /><a href='#f223' class='c011'><sup>[223]</sup></a>
have been observed, and the symptoms have been
mistaken for those of <i>cholera spontanea</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>The practitioner is therefore not to withhold his
belief in a case of poisoning, on account of the absence
of several of those symptoms which are enumerated
in systematic works on Toxicology.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is only by the study of individual cases, that he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>can learn to appreciate the just value of those pathognomonic
combinations which afford the least exceptionable
evidence upon such occasions.</p>

<h6 class='c016'><i>The different modes of Poisoning by Arsenious Acid.</i></h6>

<p class='c014'>It has been proved by numerous experiments that
the life of an animal may be destroyed with equal
certainty by arsenious acid, whether it be <em>internally</em>
administered, or <em>externally</em> applied to abraded surfaces,
sores, or bleeding wounds; and it has been,
moreover, shewn, that in either instance the symptoms
will be analogous, except in the latter case they
will often be more rapid in their course.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Lionardo di Capoa</i> relates the case of a child killed
by the violent vomiting and purging arising from a
slight wound made in the head by a comb, wet with
oil in which arsenic had been infused for the purpose
of killing vermin; and we have numerous instances
on record, where the application of arsenical
cerates and ointments has been followed by violent
and dangerous symptoms. We also learn from the
different historians of the Plague of London, that the
arsenical amulets which were worn, as preservatives,
on that occasion, were sometimes attended with deleterious
consequences; <i>Crato</i><a id='r224' /><a href='#f224' class='c011'><sup>[224]</sup></a> observed an ulcer of
the breast produced by them. <i>Verzascha</i>, violent pains
and syncope. <i>Diemerbroeck</i>,<a id='r225' /><a href='#f225' class='c011'><sup>[225]</sup></a> and Dr. <i>Hodges</i>,<a id='r226' /><a href='#f226' class='c011'><sup>[226]</sup></a>
death itself. Amongst the foreign authors who have
related cases of poisoning by the external application
of arsenic we may mention <i>Desgranges</i>,<a id='r227' /><a href='#f227' class='c011'><sup>[227]</sup></a> who records
the history of a chambermaid, poisoned by having
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>rubbed her head with an arsenical ointment for
the purpose of destroying vermin; and <i>Roux</i>,<a id='r228' /><a href='#f228' class='c011'><sup>[228]</sup></a> who
confessed to have killed a girl of eighteen by an application
of the “<i>Pâte Arsenicale</i>” to a cancerous
breast. <i>M. Renault</i> has also given us the results of
his experiments upon Arsenic when applied externally
to dogs; when the skin was sound, it excited a
pustular eruption without inflammation; but, when
the skin was broken, more serious effects followed,
both general and local, and in some cases death.<a id='r229' /><a href='#f229' class='c011'><sup>[229]</sup></a>.
In an experiment performed by Mr. <i>Hunter</i>,
and Mr. <i>Home</i>, in which arsenic was applied to a
wound in a dog, the animal died in twenty-four hours,
and the stomach was found to be considerably inflamed.
Mr. <i>Brodie</i> repeated the experiment several
times, always with the precaution of tying a bandage,
to prevent the animal licking the wound; the results
were uniform; the stomach was, in every case, not
only more violently, but more rapidly, inflamed, than
when the poison had been internally administered, and
it even preceded any inflammatory appearance of
the wound. In the <cite>Journal de Medecine</cite>, the following
case is related of a woman who was killed by her
husband having insinuated powdered arsenic into the
vagina,<a id='r230' /><a href='#f230' class='c011'><sup>[230]</sup></a> at the moment of enjoying the conjugal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>rites. “A woman at <i>Leneux, departement de l’Ourthe</i>,
aged forty, having died after a short illness, attended
with considerable tumefaction of the genital parts,
uterine hemorrhage, vomiting, and purging, the body
was inspected by order of the mayor, when the surgeons
reported that they found the vulva in a state
of gangrene, the abdomen much distended with air,
and the intestines inflamed and gangrenous. The
culprit was arrested, convicted, and executed.” In
the <cite>Acts of the Society of Copenhagen</cite>, a similar crime
stands recorded, and which was also committed by a
peasant; in this latter case, although some small
pieces of arsenic were found within the vagina, yet
some doubts arose respecting the possibility of such
a species of poisoning, and the magistrates accordingly
consulted the College of Medicine of Copenhagen,
who decided the question in the affirmative,
having first instituted a series of experiments upon
horses.</p>

<p class='c000'>Death may also be produced by the introduction
of arsenic into the rectum; it is said that Sir <i>Thomas
Overbury</i>, after the failure of the various poisons<a id='r231' /><a href='#f231' class='c011'><sup>[231]</sup></a>
that were administered to him, was at last despatched
by an arsenical glyster.</p>

<p class='c000'>With respect to the quantity of arsenic required
for the production of such effects it is difficult to offer
a decided opinion, as its operation must in every case
be liable to contingency; but a very few grains are
in general amply sufficient.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>
  <h6 class='c016'><i>Physiological action of Arsenious Acid.</i></h6>
</div>

<p class='c014'>It had long been supposed that arsenic occasioned
death by inflaming the stomach; but Mr. <i>Brodie</i><a id='r232' /><a href='#f232' class='c011'><sup>[232]</sup></a>
has very satisfactorily proved, that its influence arises
from its being absorbed, and that it must be regarded
as a <em>vital</em> rather than as a <em>chemical</em> agent, and as having
a constitutional, not a local mode of operation.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the first place, he has in many instances found
the inflammation of the stomach so slight,<a id='r233' /><a href='#f233' class='c011'><sup>[233]</sup></a> that on
a superficial examination it might have been easily
overlooked; and in most of his experiments with
arsenic, death took place in too short a period to be
considered as the mere effect of inflammation. In the
next place we have already shewn that in whatever
manner the poison is applied, whether <em>externally</em> to a
wound, or <em>internally</em>, to the alimentary canal, the
same inflammatory appearance will be visible in the
stomach; a fact which can only be explained by admitting
that the poison is absorbed, and that it acts
upon these organs through the medium of the circulation;
it acts at the same time upon the brain, and heart,
but with different degrees of force in different cases; so
that it is sometimes difficult to ascertain which of these
organs is the first to fail in its functions. According
then to these experiments and observations, inflammation
of the alimentary canal is not to be considered
as the general cause of death in poisoning by arsenic;
and yet cases will occur, where the local affection
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>may prove fatal, the animal having survived the effects
produced on the organs more immediately subservient
to life, as the brain and heart. Mr. <i>Henry Earle</i>
communicated to Mr. <i>Brodie</i> a case highly illustrative
of this fact, which occurred in St. Bartholomew’s hospital;
a woman had taken arsenic, and having recovered
from the alarming symptoms which first occurred,
died at the end of four or five days, when
upon dissection, there appeared extensive ulcerations
of the stomach and bowels. This then was evidently
a case of “<i>Consecutive</i>” poisoning.</p>

<p class='c000'>The dissertation of <i>Dr. Jaeger</i>, to which we have
before alluded, contains the result of a very extensive
series of experiments, in illustration of the physiological
action of the arsenic. He diligently examined
its effects upon all classes of organized beings, as well
of the vegetable as of the animal kingdoms. The
general conclusions which he has drawn from his
experiments on vegetables are, that arsenic is in
most cases a rapidly destructive poison to them,
with the exception perhaps of a few of the simplest
forms of existence;<a id='r234' /><a href='#f234' class='c011'><sup>[234]</sup></a> and that their death was induced
by means of the gradual absorption and distribution
of the poison by the vessels and cellular membrane,
so that the parts died in succession, as the particles
of the poison reached them. <i>Dr. Jaegar</i> also
found that arsenic was a quick and destructive poison
to animals, and that death was preceded, in every
instance, from the infusory animalcula up to man, by
inordinate motions; and that the secretion was most
remarkably increased from the mucous membranes.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>His experiments also proved that arsenic exerted the
most powerful effects, when it was injected into
the veins, or applied to a bleeding wound; next,
when it was introduced into the stomach; but less
so, when injected into the large intestines, which have
fewer absorbing vessels.<a id='r235' /><a href='#f235' class='c011'><sup>[235]</sup></a></p>

<h6 class='c016'><i>Organic Lesions, discovered on Dissection.</i></h6>

<p class='c014'>The examination of the bodies of persons poisoned
by arsenic, must not be expected to furnish constant
and uniform results, since they will be found to vary
very considerably in different cases. As we have
already considered the value of accelerated and retarded
putrefaction, as an indication of poisoning,
we shall at once proceed to the description of the
morbid phenomena which are presented by the internal
organs on dissection. The stomach and intestines
are the parts in which we may expect to find the most
decided marks of the ravages from arsenic. The
former viscus will be found more or less inflamed;
in some instances, the dusky redness will appear in
patches, interspersed with points and streaks of a
brighter hue; the villous coat of the stomach will be
almost always softened, and, as if macerated, can be
easily rubbed off in pieces with the fingers from the
coats beneath; actual ulceration and sloughing are,
according to the observations of <i>Mr. Brodie</i>, never
found unless where death is late in taking place, in
which case extensive ulceration of all the coats,
amounting to actual perforation, may be expected to
happen. This statement agrees with the observation
of <i>Ruysch</i>, who says that where there had been sufficient
time, he found the stomach ulcerated in those
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>who had died from the effects of arsenic, but that if
death supervened earlier, he only discovered bloody
points, distant from each other, throughout the viscus.
On the subject of sloughs upon such occasions,
our enlightened author remarks, that anatomists have
often been betrayed into a fallacy respecting their
true nature; on opening the stomach of a dog which
had taken a large quantity of arsenic, <i>Mr. Brodie</i>
observed a dark brown spot about an inch in diameter,
having all the appearance of a slough; on a closer
examination, however, it appeared that this spot was
no other than a very thin layer of coagulated blood,
of a dark colour, and adhering very firmly to the
surface of the mucous membrane, and having a few
particles of arsenic entangled in it. He states that
he has at several times observed a similar appearance
but occupying a less extent of surface; and he informs
us that, in the Hunterian museum, there is a human
stomach, which was preserved for the sake of exhibiting
what was considered a slough, produced by
the action of arsenic; but that, on examining the
preparation carefully, the dark coloured spot was
discovered to be simply a layer of coagulated blood,
similar to that before described. <i>Dr. Baillie</i> and <i>Dr.
Yelloly</i> have found the stomach thickened in several
parts, as if by coaguable lymph, and in one case the
thickening of the coats was the only alteration of
structure observable; and <i>M. Renault</i> relates a case,
where the arsenic was taken in large pieces, which
produced no other effect than slight syncope on the
approach of death; and that, upon opening the body,
the arsenic was found in the state it was swallowed,
but there was neither inflammation nor erosion of the
stomach. Where the arsenic has been swallowed in
substance, it will be generally found attached to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>membrane of the stomach by a peculiar glairy fluid;
if the poison should have been administered in solution,
the same organic lesions will be discovered, but
the presence of the arsenic in the stomach can scarcely
be expected, although the contents of the viscus,
as well as all the matter ejected from the body before
death, must be carefully examined by a chemical
process to be hereafter described. The duodenum,
like the stomach, generally affords evidence of the
same inflamed and disorganized condition; and the
whole track of the intestinal canal will be found more
or less affected, according to the quantity of arsenic
that has been administered, the period of time which
has elapsed before death, and other circumstances
which have been already enumerated as capable of
modifying the action of this destructive substance.
It however deserves notice that in many cases the
rectum appears to be more affected than the other
intestines; <i>Dr. Male</i><a id='r236' /><a href='#f236' class='c011'><sup>[236]</sup></a> states, that he has frequently
found it abraded and ulcerated, and even more inflamed
than the stomach itself; <i>Mr. Brodie</i> likewise
observed, in his physiological experiments upon this
substance, that the inflammation produced by it was
greatest in the stomach and the rectum. <i>Dr. Baillie</i>
has recorded several instances where a mortification
of the rectum followed as an effect of this poison;
and in the case of <i>Mr. Blandy</i>, detailed in the <i>Appendix</i>,
p. 237, <i>Dr. Addington</i> stated, that the extremity
of the rectum was extremely painful, and surrounded
by excoriations and ulcers.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Mr. Brodie</i> has stated, in the paper to which we
have so often alluded, that the organic lesions occasioned
by arsenic are confined to the stomach and <a id='int'></a>intestines,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>and that he <em>never found any appearance of
inflammation in the pharynx or œsophagus</em>. This
statement, however, is at variance with a great weight
of authority; we have ourselves witnessed cases in
which dissection has demonstrated extensive inflammation
in these parts; indeed it would appear, that
this poison acts more particularly on the mucous
membranes; and it is reasonable therefore to conclude,
that those with which it comes in actual contact
will not escape its virulence. The serous membranes
which receive less blood, and more lymphatics,
are necessarily less affected by it.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the case of <i>William Mitchell</i>, as related at <i>page</i>
<a href='#Page_188'>188</a>, the patient complained of soreness of the eyes,
heat and uneasiness in the mouth and throat; and
the surgeon observed the membrane on the palate
and uvula to be detached; so in that, again, of <i>Mr.
Blandy</i>, <i>Dr. Addington</i> found on inspection that
“his tongue was swelled, and his throat inflamed
and excoriated; his lips, especially the upper one,
dry and rough, and having angry pimples on them;
the inside of his nostrils in the same condition, and
his eyes a little blood shot.” (<i>Append.</i> <i>l. c.</i>). In the
celebrated Scotch case of <i>Oglivy</i> and <i>Nairne</i> (<i>see
page</i> <a href='#Page_184'>184</a>) <i>Peter Meik</i>, surgeon of Alyth, deposed,
that, upon inspecting the body four or five days afterwards,
he found “the tongue swelled beyond its
natural size, and cleaving to the roof of the mouth,
which he had never observed after a natural death.”
Many more instances might be adduced to shew that
the fauces, pharynx, and œsophagus are very frequently
inflamed and excoriated by the ingestion of
arsenic. Mortification of the pudenda<a id='r237' /><a href='#f237' class='c011'><sup>[237]</sup></a> has been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>said to be an effect peculiar to the action of arsenic;
certain it is that in males, priapism is sometimes a
symptom of this poison, and the penis is found swollen
and red after death, as was observed in the case
of <i>William Mitchell</i> (p. <a href='#Page_190'>190</a>). The scrotum was also
enlarged and of a dark colour. We have been long
aware that persons exposed to the fumes of arsenic,
or accustomed to handle any of its preparations, have
been liable to a peculiar affection of these parts, but
we have generally explained the fact by supposing
that the poison had in such cases, been locally applied
to them. The author has been lately informed by
his friend <i>Mr. Parkes</i>, that several persons in his
establishment were thus attacked, during the time
they were engaged in preparing an arsenical solution,
as a dye for the calico printers; and we have stated
on another occasion,<a id='r238' /><a href='#f238' class='c011'><sup>[238]</sup></a> that the smelters and workmen
engaged in the copper works, and tin burning
houses of Cornwall, are occasionally affected with a
cancerous disease in the scrotum, somewhat similar
to that which infests chimney sweepers. It is also
singular that <i>Stahl</i>, in describing the putrescent tendency
in the bodies of those who die from this poison,
mentions in particular the gangrenous appearances
of the parts of generation. The other organs of the
body do not exhibit any particular appearances,
which ought to be regarded as characteristic of death
by arsenic; we must necessarily expect to find the
traces of morbid action, especially where life has
been unusually protracted; and the serous effusions
found in the body of <i>William Mitchell</i>, are to be
referred to such a cause.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Mr. Brodie</i> has stated that, in animals killed by
arsenic, the blood is usually found fluid in the heart
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>and vessels after death; this agrees with the observation
of <i>Ruysch</i>, who says that he never found the
blood coagulated in the human body, after death occasioned
by this poison; as well as with that of <i>Dr.
Jaeger</i>, who describes the cavities of the heart, especially
of the right side, to be, upon these occasions,
turgid with blood, but that coagula are very seldom
found in them.</p>

<p class='c000'>A question, of a very considerable importance in a
forensic point of view, has arisen with respect to the
means, by which we may distinguish whether arsenic,
found in the body, had been introduced into the digestive
canal during life, or after death. In general,
this fact is placed beyond suspicion by the testimony
of those to whose care the body had been confided,
previous to dissection. But cases have occurred
where a poisonous substance has been introduced into
the rectum of a dead body, with the diabolical intention
of accusing an innocent person of having been
the perpetrator of the poisoning. We are not aware
of any English case of this kind, but <i>M. Orfila</i> states
that in the proceedings of the Criminal Court of
Stockholm such a case stands recorded. Fortunately
there would not be much difficulty in detecting the
crime; for were the arsenic applied to the rectum
after death, the change of structure would not extend
beyond the part in actual contact with it, but
would be distinctly separated from the rest of the intestine
<em>by a well defined line of demarcation</em>, which can
never happen where the arsenic has acted during life;
for, in this latter case, the transition from the diseased
to the healthy structure will be gradual, and
the limits of each imperceptible.</p>

<p class='c000'>Before we conclude our observations upon the organic
lesions occasioned by arsenic, we may caution
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>the anatomist not to confound the red or violet colour
which characterises inflammation, with that which
has been occasionally found to arise from the ingestion
of certain coloured drinks. The following case
related by <i>Foderé</i>, and cited by <i>Orfila</i>, may serve to
illustrate this subject. “A private person of Châlons
sur-Marne, who was in a state of convalescence from
a disease under which he had laboured, took a slight
purgative, and died very shortly afterwards. He was
believed to have been poisoned through some error in
the medicine, and in order to be assured of this, the
body was opened. The œsophagus and stomach were
found to be red, and in certain places livid, as if in a
state of gangrene. These appearances at first induced a
belief that the deceased had died from poison; but
<i>M. Varnier</i>, a physician of Châlons, concluded from
the appearances, that death was the consequence of
the disease, and that the apparent convalescence was
only an insidious respite. It became therefore necessary
to give some account of the state of the œsophagus
and stomach; and having learnt that the deceased
was in the habit of using a <em>strong infusion of red poppies</em>,
the idea immediately struck him that the extraordinary
colour of these organs might possibly depend
on this infusion. In order to determine the validity
of this explanation, he caused a dog to swallow, several
times, a similar infusion; when upon opening
its body, he discovered that the corresponding parts
of this animal had assumed the same colour as had
been observed in the stomach of the deceased above-mentioned,
and, moreover, that this violet red colour
was so firmly fixed that it resisted the action of repeated
washings.” <i>Tincture of Cardamoms</i> will also
be liable to occasion a coloured appearance in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>stomach, as described in <i>Mr. Stanley’s</i> case of the
death of a woman by a dose of opium.<a id='r239' /><a href='#f239' class='c011'><sup>[239]</sup></a></p>

<h6 class='c016'><i>Of the Chemical Processes, by which the presence of Arsenious Acid may be detected.</i></h6>

<p class='c014'>This poison may either be submitted to the judicial
physician for examination, in its solid form, or in
that of solution; and in this latter state it may be
mixed with various alimentary substances, whose presence
will necessarily embarrass the inexperienced
operator, and multiply the apparent difficulties of his
task. It becomes our duty, therefore, upon this occasion,
to enter very fully and minutely into the history
of the various processes, which have been proposed
for the solution of the important problem under
consideration; to appreciate the relative value
of each, and to point out the sources of fallacy and
failure, to which they are severally exposed.</p>

<p class='c000'>Such a review of the subject would, moreover, appear
to be essentially necessary at the present period,
since the evidence, lately delivered on an extraordinary
trial,<a id='r240' /><a href='#f240' class='c011'><sup>[240]</sup></a> has, to a certain extent, very unjustly
shaken the public confidence in the tests of chemistry.
We shall therefore proceed to consider the processes
which are calculated to lead to the detection of
<i>Arsenic</i>, in relation to the different circumstances
under which it may be presented for investigation,
viz. 1, In a solid form; 2, In the simple state of solution;
and 3, In the state of combination with various
alimentary substances.</p>

<p class='c000'>1. <i>The Arsenic is in a solid form.</i> This is the most
simple case which can occur, and the experiments by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>which its presence is to be demonstrated, will constitute
the basis of the inquiry, which we shall be hereafter
called upon to institute, for the detection of the
same substance under other circumstances of mixture
and combination.</p>

<p class='c000'>The order of succession to be observed in the different
experiments which we are about to describe,
must, in a great measure, be regulated by the quantity
of the material to be submitted to examination.
Should it be small, it will be prudent to reserve the
process of metallization, by which a considerable loss
must necessarily arise, until we have submitted it to
the various re-agents which are calculated to afford
indications of its nature. If, on the contrary, the
quantity of the substance exceed two or three grains,
it will be adviseable to proceed in its examination by
the following processes, reserving a portion for future
analysis.</p>

<p class='c000'>A. <i>By its reduction to a metallic state.</i> Mix a portion
of the suspected substance in powder, with three
times its weight of <i>black flux</i><a id='r241' /><a href='#f241' class='c011'><sup>[241]</sup></a>; put the mixture
into a thin glass tube, about eight inches in length,
and a quarter of an inch in diameter, and which is
hermetically sealed<a id='r242' /><a href='#f242' class='c011'><sup>[242]</sup></a> at one end. Should any of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>powder adhere to the sides of the tube it must be
carefully brushed off with a feather, so that the inner
surface of its upper part may be perfectly clean and
dry. The closed end of the tube, by way of security,
may be thinly coated with a mixture of pipe-clay
and sand<a id='r243' /><a href='#f243' class='c011'><sup>[243]</sup></a>; but this operation is not absolutely
necessary. The open extremity of the tube is
to be loosely plugged with a piece of paper. The
coated end must now be submitted to the action of
heat, by placing it in a chaffing dish of red hot coals,
for ten minutes, or a quarter of an hour; when, if
our supposition respecting the nature of the substance
has been correct, metallic arsenic will sublime, and
be found lining the upper part of the tube with a brilliant
metallic crust. The glass tube, when cold,
may be separated from its sealed end by the action
of a file, which will enable us to collect and examine
the metallic sublimate. If a portion of this brilliant
matter be laid on heated iron, it will indicate its nature
by exhaling in dense fumes, having a powerful
smell of garlic. Another portion should be reserved
for future experiments.</p>

<p class='c000'>This method of detecting the presence of <i>Arsenious
acid</i> has been considered the most decisive, and
indeed the only unexceptionable one, but of this
we shall speak hereafter; at present we have only to
observe, that it is very far from being a minute test,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>for <i>Dr. Bostock</i><a id='r244' /><a href='#f244' class='c011'><sup>[244]</sup></a> confesses that where less than
<em>three-fourths of a grain</em> were used, he could not say
that the metallic crust was clearly perceptible; and
<i>Dr. Black</i><a id='r245' /><a href='#f245' class='c011'><sup>[245]</sup></a> appears to have considered that <em>one
grain</em> was the smallest quantity which could be distinctly
recognised by such a process.</p>

<p class='c000'>Chemists were formerly<a id='r246' /><a href='#f246' class='c011'><sup>[246]</sup></a> in the habit of at once
projecting any substance, supposed to be <i>Arsenic</i>,
on some burning body, in order to develope the
alliaceous odour; we have accidentally stumbled
upon an instance of this kind, in the fourth volume
of the <cite>London Medical and Physical Journal</cite>,
which may serve as an illustration; it is a case
communicated by <i>F. Thackeray, Esq.</i> of a child
poisoned by arsenic, in which the author says,
“<em>the inner surface of the stomach was very red, and
was studded throughout with a white powder, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>when exposed to the flame of a candle, yielded fumes,
and a garlic odour was emitted, proving it was arsenic;
of which there can be no doubt, as the girl afterwards
confessed that she had given arsenic to the infant</em>.”</p>

<p class='c000'>After the facts we have offered with respect to the
<i>alliaceous odour</i> of arsenical fumes, it is only necessary
to state, in this place, that such a test, when conducted
in the manner just related, must be considered
as extremely equivocal.</p>

<p class='c000'>Another method of identifying “<i>White Arsenic</i>,”
by metallization, is to form at the moment of its reduction,
an alloy with copper, which may be easily
effected in the following manner: Mix the suspected
powder with <i>black flux</i>, as in the former experiment,
and place the mixture between two polished plates of
copper; bind them tightly together by iron wire, and
expose them to a low red heat; if the included substance
contain arsenic, a silvery white stain will be
left on the surface of the copper, which is an alloy of
the two metals. In this, as in the former experiment,
the presence of an <i>alkali</i> in the flux is essential,
since it forms immediately an <i>arsenite of potass</i>, and
thereby fixes the arsenious acid, and prevents it
from being volatilized before the temperature is sufficiently
high to enable the charcoal to decompose it;
we therefore differ with <i>Dr. Bostock</i>, when he states
that <i>powdered charcoal</i> may be substituted for the
<i>black flux</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>The property of <i>whitening</i> copper is regarded as a
very satisfactory test of the presence of arsenic; but
<i>Dr. Bostock</i> has pointed out some circumstances attending
it, which we shall here enumerate for the instruction
and satisfaction of the less experienced operator.
“It may be necessary,” says he, “in the first
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>place, to describe the phenomena that take place
when copper is heated according to the process that
is described above, but without the addition of the
arsenic. Two copper disks, of nearly an inch and a
half in diameter, scoured bright with sand, had one
grain of powdered charcoal, made into a paste with
oil, placed between them; they were bound together
with an iron wire, and then kept red hot for ten minutes.
When they were withdrawn from the fire,
the metal was found to have lost its former appearance,
and to have acquired the dull white colour of
lead or zinc; the insides of the disks were found to
present the same whitish appearance, except on the
spot where the charcoal was placed, a small part of
which still remained unconsumed. As the disks
cooled the whitish matter which covered them began
to separate, and fly off with some force, in the form
of small scales, leaving a clean surface of the proper
copper colour. The charcoal was rubbed off, and
the surface below it was found smooth and polished;
it had acquired a light colour, resembling that of
brass; and, near the centre, there was a small spot,
which approached to a steel grey. This appearance
still continued, after it had been rubbed with fine
sand. The above description,” concludes <i>Dr. Bostock</i>,
“will probably impress the Society<a id='r247' /><a href='#f247' class='c011'><sup>[247]</sup></a> with
the same idea, that, I confess, it gave to myself, that
if I had performed this experiment upon a substance,
which had been suspected to contain arsenic, and I
had not been aware of the appearance that I was to
meet with, I should have conceived that I had detected
its presence. Upon repeating the process, in
precisely a similar manner, except that one grain of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>arsenic was added to the charcoal, the oxidation of
the copper took place as before, and a small part of
the charcoal remained unconsumed; but upon rubbing
it, the white stain was perfectly visible. However,
when these disks were compared with those in
which the former experiment had been made, the
difference between them seemed more in <em>degree</em> than
in <em>kind</em>; so that I should not choose to decide upon
the presence of arsenic, as indicated by this test,
unless the result were more obvious than we can ever
expect to find it, where the quantity of arsenic is so
small. It may be proper to observe, that copper,
whitened in this manner by arsenic, is very subject
to tarnish; in three days I could with difficulty distinguish
which of the disks had been employed in
these two experiments.”</p>

<p class='c000'>In connection with the different modes of identifying
arsenic by metallization, we may relate a test
lately proposed by <i>Mr. A. Thomson</i>, which, as a
collateral proof, merits some attention. “Into any
solution, in which arsenic may be suspected, stir a
moderate quantity of charcoal powder; allow it to
settle; then pour off the clear supernatant liquor, or
filter the mixture; and when the powder which remains
on the filter is dry, sprinkle some of it on a red
hot poker; if the solution contain arsenic, the odour
of garlic will be rendered sensible. This effect becomes
more obvious if a few grains of dry sub-carbonate
of potass be added to the dried charcoal powder.”<a id='r248' /><a href='#f248' class='c011'><sup>[248]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>If, instead of <i>Black flux</i>, or charcoal, the arsenious
acid be heated in a glass tube with quick-lime, a sudden
ignition will take place, when one part of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>white arsenic will be metallized, and the other
farther acidified, so as to produce an <i>arseniate of
lime</i>; in this case, therefore, a certain portion of the
arsenious acid is robbed of its oxygen to complete
the acidification of the rest.</p>

<p class='c000'>The habitudes of arsenious acid with the <i>nitrates</i>,
as first observed by <i>Kunkel</i>, deserve also some attention.
If they be heated together, the former will be
oxygenated at the expense of the nitric acid, nitrous
acid vapour will be disengaged, and an <i>arseniate of
potass</i> remain. The forensic chemist may avail himself
of these facts, and obtain a very useful test,
which may be applied in the following manner.<a id='r249' /><a href='#f249' class='c011'><sup>[249]</sup></a>
Take a grain or two of the suspected powder, and
mix it with double the quantity of <i>Nitrate of Potass</i>;
introduce this mixture in a small glass tube, and apply
the flame of a spirit lamp under the powder;
when, if it contain arsenic, the nitrate will be decomposed,
nitric oxide and nitrous acid be evolved in
a gaseous form, and an arseniate of potass remain.</p>

<p class='c000'>The acid vapour may be easily recognised by its
colour and smell, or by placing a piece of moistened
litmus paper within the tube. The <i>arseniate</i> may be
identified by the <i>brick-red</i> precipitate, produced in its
solution, by <i>Nitrate</i> of Silver. So small is the quantity
of arsenic required for this latter mode of trial,
that <i>Mr. Smithson</i>, in a late paper, observes “that a
drop of a solution of arsenious acid in water, which
at the height of 54·5 <i>Fah.</i> contains not more than
1/80th of the acid, put to nitrate of potass in a platina
spoon, and fused, affords a considerable quantity
of <i>arseniate</i> of silver. Hence when no solid particle
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>of oxide of arsenic can be obtained, the presence of
it may be established by infusing in water the matters
which contain it.”<a id='r250' /><a href='#f250' class='c011'><sup>[250]</sup></a></p>

    <div>B. <i>By the application of certain re-agents, or tests, to its solutions.</i></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><i>a.</i> <i>Fused Nitrate of Silver, or Lunar Caustic.</i> For
this test we are indebted to <i>Mr. Hume</i>, who first
suggested its application in the <a id='phi'></a>Philosophical Magazine
for May 1809, (vol. xxxiii). His method of
using it is as follows: into a clean Florence flask introduce
two or three grains of the suspected substance,
in the state of powder, to which add about
eight ounces of rain or distilled water, and heat the
solution until it begins to boil; then while it boils
frequently shake the flask, and add to the hot solution
a grain or two of sub-carbonate of potass, agitating
the whole to make the mixture uniform. Pour into
a wine glass about two table spoonsful of the solution,
and touch the surface of the fluid with a stick of lunar
caustic. If arsenic be present, a beautiful yellow
precipitate will instantly proceed from the point of
contact, and settle towards the bottom of the glass as
a flocculent and copious precipitate. By this test the
60th part of a grain may be satisfactorily recognised
in two ounces of water. The presence of some alkali
is essential to the success of the experiment, since
arsenious acid is incapable, by the operation of simple
affinity, to decompose the <i>nitrate of silver</i>.<a id='r251' /><a href='#f251' class='c011'><sup>[251]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>The validity of this test has been questioned on several
distinct grounds, and which the author has endeavoured
to answer in another work<a id='r252' /><a href='#f252' class='c011'><sup>[252]</sup></a>; such, however,
is the importance of the question in its judicial
consequences, that we shall re-consider it on the present
occasion.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Objection 1.</span> <i>The alkaline Phosphates are found
to produce precipitates with silver, analogous in colour
and appearance to the arsenite of silver.</i> This constituted
one of the principal points in the evidence for
the defence, on the trial of <i>Donnall</i> for the murder
of <i>Mrs. Downing</i> (<i>see Appendix</i>, p. 299), and it must
be admitted as a valid objection, if the experiment
be performed in the manner just stated; but there
are other reagents which will immediately distinguish
these bodies, as we shall presently have occasion to
state, under the history of the <i>Ammoniuret of silver</i>,
as a test for arsenic. The author has also shewn
that there is a mode of so modifying the application of
the present test, that no error or doubt can arise in
the use of it, from the presence of any phosphoric
salt. This method consists in conducting the trial on
writing paper, instead of in glasses; thus—drop the
suspected fluid on a piece of white paper, making
with it a broad line; along this line a stick of <i>lunar
caustic</i> is to be slowly drawn several times successively,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>when a streak is produced of a colour resembling
that known by the name of <i>Indian Yellow</i>; and
this is equally produced by the presence of arsenic,
and that of an alkaline phosphate, but the one from
the former is rough, curdy, and flocculent, as if effected
by a crayon, that from the latter is homogeneous
and uniform, resembling a water-colour laid smoothly
on with a brush; but a more important and distinctive
peculiarity soon succeeds, for, in less than two
minutes the phosphoric yellow fades into a <i>sad green</i>,
and becomes gradually darker, and ultimately quite
black; while, on the other hand, the arsenical yellow
remains permanent, or nearly so, for some time,
when it becomes brown. In performing this experiment
the sun-shine should be avoided, or the transitions
of colour will take place too rapidly. It would
be also prudent for the inexperienced operator to
perform a similar experiment on a fluid known to
contain arsenic, and on another with a phosphoric
salt, as a standard of comparison.</p>

<p class='c000'>In this way the <i>nitrate of silver</i>, without the intervention
of any other test, is capable of removing
every ambiguity, and of furnishing a distinguishing
mark between the chemical action of arsenic and
that of the phosphates. <i>Mr. Hume</i><a id='r253' /><a href='#f253' class='c011'><sup>[253]</sup></a> states that
he has repeated this modification of his experiment
with entire satisfaction; and that, in a late unfortunate
case of poisoning, he derived considerable information
by its application. One of the great advantages
of this test is the very small quantity that is
required for examination, and which will therefore
never prevent our pursuing the subject through the
other channels of investigation.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Objection 2.</span> <i>The muriates produce precipitates
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>with silver, so copious and flocculent, as to overcome
every indication which the presence of arsenic would
otherwise afford.</i></p>

<p class='c000'>From the general use of common salt, the chemist
must be prepared to meet with a <i>muriate</i> in almost
every examination after arsenic, besides which this
latter substance is occasionally adulterated with the
<i>muriate of baryta</i> and by <i>sulphate of lime</i>. <i>Dr. Marcet</i>
proposes to obviate the difficulties which the presence
of a <i>muriate</i> must occasion, by adding to the fluid to be
examined dilute <i>nitric</i> acid, and then cautiously applying
the <i>nitrate of silver</i> until all precipitation ceases; in
this way the muriatic acid will be entirely removed,
while the arsenic, if present, will be retained in solution,
and may be afterwards rendered evident by the
affusion of ammonia, which will instantly produce
the yellow precipitate in its characteristic form. It
must, however, be confessed, that this mode appears
complicated, and, moreover, requires some chemical
address for its accomplishment; it should be also known
that the yellow precipitate thus produced is not always
permanent, for it is soluble in an excess of <i>ammonia</i>.
Under these circumstances, it is surely preferable to
precipitate at once from the fluid under examination,
all the substances which nitrate of silver can affect,
and then to expose the mixed and ambiguous precipitate,
so obtained, to a low heat, in a glass tube,
when the arsenious acid will be separated by sublimation.
In this way the presence of <i>muriates</i> and
even <i>phosphates</i>, may, in certain cases, be serviceable,
especially if the quantity of arsenic be very minute;
for, by increasing the bulk of the precipitate, we shall
decrease the difficulty of its examination.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Objection 3.</span> <i>Chromate of potass produces with
nitrate of silver a yellow precipitate, which, when placed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>side by side with one produced by arsenious acid, cannot
be distinguished by colour or appearance from it.</i>
This fact has lately been announced by Dr. Porter,
of the University of South Carolina (<cite>Silliman’s Journal</cite>,
<i>iii.</i> 355); but as the presence of <i>Chromate of
Potass</i> can never be suspected in any research after
arsenic, in cases of forensic interest, it is unnecessary
to enter into any details respecting it.</p>

<p class='c000'>We have stated above, that in consequence of the
inability of arsenious acid to decompose <i>nitrate of
silver</i> by simple elective attraction, the presence of
<em>some</em> alkali becomes indispensable in the examination;
and for this purpose <i>Dr. Marcet</i> suggested the
superior advantages which would attend the application
of <i>ammonia</i>, in all those cases where the arsenic
had not been previously combined with a fixed alkali;
since the former does not, when added singly, decompose
nitrate of silver; a circumstance which, in
using the fixed alkalies, is very liable to occasion
fallacy. This led <i>Mr. Hume</i> to improve his original
plan, by forming at once a compound,<a id='r254' /><a href='#f254' class='c011'><sup>[254]</sup></a> which he calls
the <i>Ammoniaco-nitrate of silver</i>, but which may with
more propriety be designated, as an <i>ammoniuret</i> of
that metal.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>b.</i> The <i>Ammoniuret of Silver</i>. This is an improvement
of considerable value; for, while it obviates the
necessity of ascertaining the exact proportion<a id='r255' /><a href='#f255' class='c011'><sup>[255]</sup></a> of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>alkali required in each experiment, it possesses the
desirable property of not in the least disturbing the
solution of <i>phosphate of soda</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>c.</i> <i>Sulphate of Copper.</i> This test of arsenic is the
one discovered by <i>Scheele</i>; when added to the <i>arsenite
of potass</i> a beautiful green precipitate (constituting a
pigment known by the name of <i>Scheele’s green</i>) is
produced; “so decidedly,” says <i>Dr. Bostock</i>, “does
this phenomenon indicate the presence of arsenic,
that I thought it desirable to ascertain, as exactly as
possible, what were the best proportions in which
the ingredients should be employed, and in what way
they should be mixed, so as to exhibit the effect in
the most obvious manner. After a number of trials,
in which the substances were employed in various
quantities, and under different circumstances, I am
disposed to recommend that the proportions of the
<i>arsenic</i>, the <i>potass</i>, and the <i>sulphate of copper</i>, should
be to each other as the numbers <i>one</i>, <i>three</i>, and <i>five</i>,
respectively; for instance, if one grain of arsenic and
three grains of potass, be dissolved in two drachms
of water; and, in another equal quantity of water,
five grains of sulphate be dissolved, we have two
solutions, which are transparent, and nearly colourless;
but upon mixing them together, the whole is
converted into the most beautiful grass-green, from
which a copious precipitate of the same hue slowly
subsides, leaving the supernatant fluid nearly without
colour. If the same materials are employed,
in the same manner, but without the arsenic, a delicate
<i>sky-blue</i> is formed, which is so decidedly different
from the former colour as not to admit of the possibility
of error.” In this experiment then, as well as
in that with the nitrate of silver, it is necessary that
the arsenious acid should be combined with an alkaline
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>base; and for the same reason, in order to bring
the double elective attractions into play; <i>Mr. Hume</i>
has accordingly availed himself of the property of
ammonia, to form an <i>ammoniuret of copper</i>, which is
to be made according to the formula already given
for the preparation of the silver test.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>d.</i> <i>Ammoniuret of Copper.</i> In using this test care
must be taken that it be not too highly concentrated,
for in that state it will not produce precipitation.</p>

<p class='c000'>Notwithstanding the confidence with which <i>Dr.
Bostock</i> has supported the pretensions of the <i>Sulphate
of Copper</i>, as an infallible test for arsenic,
its validity has been lately called in question, and
it has been stated that a <em>decoction of onions</em> has the
property of imparting to the copper precipitate, produced
by a fixed alkali, a green colour and appearance
completely analogous to that which is occasioned
by the presence of arsenic. This opinion was boldly
advanced, and supported, on the trial of <i>Donnall</i>, before
alluded to, and of which we have given a very
ample report in the <i>Appendix</i>. Since this event an
opportunity occurred which enabled the author to
examine this alleged fact, by a fair and appropriate
series of experiments,<a id='r256' /><a href='#f256' class='c011'><sup>[256]</sup></a> the result of which has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>satisfactorily proved that the opinion was grounded
on an optical fallacy, arising from the <em>blue</em> precipitate
assuming a <em>green</em> colour, in consequence of having
been viewed through a yellow medium.<a id='r257' /><a href='#f257' class='c011'><sup>[257]</sup></a> The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>phosphoric salts may also, under similar circumstances,
be mistaken for arsenic; for the intense blue colour
of the <i>phosphate of copper</i> will, when viewed through
a yellow medium, necessarily appear green. Such
instances of optical fallacy are by no means uncommon
in the history of chemical reagents; thus <i>corrosive
sublimate</i> has been said to possess alkaline characters,
in consequence of appearing to turn the
syrup of violets green, whereas this apparent change
is to be solely attributed to the optical combination
of the yellow hue of the sublimate with the blue colour
of the violet.</p>

<p class='c000'>Whenever therefore such a source of fallacy can
be suspected, the operator would do well to repeat
his experiment on white paper, in the manner we
have already pointed out, when treating of the silver
test; and let it be remembered that the results, when
obtained in glasses, should always be examined by
day light, and viewed by reflected, and not by transmitted
light. <i>Dr. Bostock</i> observes, that a weak
solution of the sulphate of copper, without any addition,
when held between the eye and the window,
frequently presents a greenish tinge. It should be
also known that the usual reaction of the <i>ammoniuret
of copper</i>, upon a diluted solution of arsenic, is prevented
by the presence of <i>tannin</i>; strong tea may
therefore render the test inefficient.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>e.</i> <i>Sulphuretted hydrogen.</i> This is a very delicate
test for arsenic, producing with its solution a beautiful
golden coloured liquor, which, after a short time,
lets fall a precipitate, and which will take place sooner
if a small quantity of acetic acid be added. By this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>re-agent so small a quantity as 1/100000 may be detected
in solution. The test, however, is not, says
<i>Dr. Bostock</i>, sufficiently discriminative to be depended
upon alone; since <i>tartarized antimony</i> and
some other bodies, will produce phenomena that may
be mistaken for the effects of arsenic. It has, however,
the merit of not being affected by <i>tannin</i>, and
may therefore be conveniently employed for precipitating
arsenious acid, when dissolved in tea.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>f.</i> <i>Lime water</i> produces with the solution of arsenic
a beautiful white precipitate of <i>arsenite of lime</i>, which
easily dissolves in an excess of arsenious acid.</p>

<p class='c000'>The precipitates occasioned by the foregoing reagents,
should be carefully collected, and treated
with <i>black flux</i>, in a glass tube, for the purpose of
obtaining the metallic sublimate, as above described.</p>

<p class='c000'>We cannot quit this part of our subject without
directing the reader’s attention to the chemical evidence
given by <i>Dr. Addington</i>, on the trial of <i>Mary
Blandy</i> (<i>see Appendix, p.</i> 241) to prove that arsenic
was contained in a powder with which she was supposed
to have poisoned her father. To those in the
least acquainted with the habitudes of arsenious acid,
it must be evident, that no one of the appearances
described by <i>Dr. Addington</i> indicates the presence of
arsenic;<a id='r258' /><a href='#f258' class='c011'><sup>[258]</sup></a> and his evidence is only to be reconciled
upon the supposition that, instead of the arsenic itself,
he, in this case, detected the foreign substances with
which it had been adulterated; thus it has been before
stated that <i>white arsenic</i>, as sold by the druggists,
is often adulterated with <i>sulphate of lime</i>; and the
decomposition of this substance by the <i>sub-carbonate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>of ammonia</i> (“<i>Spirit of sal-ammoniac</i>”) or by the
<i>sub-carbonate of potass</i> (“<i>Lixivium of tartar</i>”) would
occasion the precipitation of a white substance, as
stated in the evidence; it is however difficult to account
for the “considerable precipitation of a lightish
coloured substance” by muriatic acid (<i>spirit of
salt</i>) by the presence of any impurity likely to be
contained in the arsenic, or in the water employed
for its solution. If any lime were present, it would
probably give “white glittering crystals” of sulphate
of lime, by the addition of sulphuric acid
(<i>spirits of vitriol</i>). The only plausible evidence of
the presence of arsenic in the suspected powder is
“the alliaceous smell and white flowers” which <i>Dr.
Addington</i> describes as occurring when it was thrown
on red hot iron; it must however be confessed, that
from the fallacy of the other experiments, it is even
impossible to place any confidence in those last mentioned.</p>

<p class='c000'>Arsenic does not blacken a knife by which it is cut,
as stated on the trial of <i>Eliza Fenning</i>; nor does it,
when mixed with dough, prevent its rising.<a id='r259' /><a href='#f259' class='c011'><sup>[259]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>We have now concluded our history of the different
tests which have been proposed for the detection
of arsenic. Much has been said and written upon
the relative degree of confidence to which they are
respectively entitled, and it has been asserted on several
occasions, that nothing short of the reproduction
of the metal ought to be received by the tribunals
of justice, as an unequivocal proof of the presence
of arsenious acid. (See <i>Dr. Neale’s Evidence
on the trial of Donnall</i>. <i>Appendix, p.</i> 297.) In taking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>an impartial review of all the evidence which
the investigation of this subject can furnish, it must
appear to the most fastidious, that the <i>Silver</i> and
<i>Copper</i> tests, above described, are capable, under
proper management and precaution, of furnishing
striking and infallible indications; and that in most
cases they will be equally conclusive, and in some
even more satisfactory in their results, than the metallic
reproduction upon which so much stress has
been laid; and for this obvious reason, that unless
the quantity of metal be considerable, its metallic
splendour and appearance is often very ambiguous
and questionable. The author is personally acquainted
with a case, where the medical person, by no
means deficient in chemical address, actually ascribed
the presence of arsenic to that which was no
other than a film of finely divided charcoal: in this
state of doubt the last resource was to ascertain
whether it yielded, or not, upon being volatilized,
an alliaceous odour. Surely an unprejudiced judge
would prefer the evidence of <em>sight</em>, as furnished by
the tests, to that of <em>smell</em>, as afforded in the experiment
to which we allude; especially after the various
fallacies, which we have shewn in the course of the
present enquiry, to have occurred with regard to this
latter sense. But the question at issue may be easily
disposed of to the satisfaction of all parties; for let it
be remembered, that the application of chemical reagents
on solutions suspected to contain arsenic, so
far from throwing any obstacle in the way of the <em>metallic
reproduction</em> of that substance, are the very steps
which should be adopted as preparatory to the “<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">experimentum
crucis</span></i>.” It is only necessary to collect
the precipitates, and to decompose them in the manner
already described; and this confirmation of our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>results should never be neglected, for it is the bounden
duty of the forensic chemist, who is called upon
to decide so important a question as the presence of a
corrosive poison, to prosecute by the fullest enquiry
every point which admits of the least doubt; he
should also remember that in a criminal case, where
the life of a human being depends upon his testimony,
he has not only to satisfy his own conscience, but
that he is bound, as far as he is able, to convince the
public mind of the accuracy and truth of his researches.</p>

    <div>2. <i>The Arsenious Acid is mixed with various alimentary and other substances.</i></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The detection of the presence of arsenic, amidst a
complicated mass of alimentary matter, has long been
a problem of interest and difficulty. In the directions
which have been already offered for the discovery
of arsenic in solution, we have in some measure
anticipated several of the resources, of which we are
now to avail ourselves. It has been seen how greatly
coloured fluids are capable of obscuring, and changing,
and even altogether preventing, the arsenical
indications. <i>M. Orfila</i>, with an assiduity and accuracy
which so eminently characterise all his toxicological
labours, has accordingly investigated the peculiar
appearances assumed by the arsenical precipitates
in different media, such as bile, tea, coffee, wine,
broth, jelly, &amp;c. Since the publication of the great
work<a id='r260' /><a href='#f260' class='c011'><sup>[260]</sup></a> in which these phenomena are recorded, its
author has proposed a new method<a id='r261' /><a href='#f261' class='c011'><sup>[261]</sup></a> of removing its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>difficulties and <a id='emb'></a>embarrassments, occasioned by the colouring
matter of the above media; which consists in
a previous application of <i>Chlorine</i>, so as to change
the colour to a shade, that will not offer any optical
impediment to the characteristic indications of the
tests in question. We are ready to admit that such
a mode of proceeding may, on certain occasions, assist
the accomplished chemist in his analysis; but in
the hands of a person less accustomed to chemical
manipulation, we hesitate not to declare that it is
subject to fatal fallacies; whereas, by collecting the
precipitate, and submitting it to the process of sublimation
we shall at once obtain the arsenious acid in a
pure form, and be enabled to test it, in distilled
water without the chance of error. Why then should
we attempt to pursue our game through the windings
of a labyrinth, when a direct road lies before us by
which we may drive it into the open plain?</p>

<p class='c000'>We accordingly recommend the juridical chemist,
who suspects the presence of arsenious acid in broth,
coffee, or any coloured liquid, to add a solution of
<i>ammoniuret of silver</i>, and thus to precipitate indiscriminately
all the bodies which it may be capable of
so affecting. The precipitate may then be collected,
and submitted to heat in a glass tube, as before directed.</p>

<p class='c000'>But the <i>Arsenious acid</i> may perchance be so mixed
with various foreign matter as to render its separation
by filtration difficult; in such a case, after having
boiled it in distilled water, in order to procure all the
soluble matter from it, the residual mass may be evaporated
to dryness, care being taken that the heat
applied for such a purpose never exceeds 250° <i>Fah.</i> or
we shall lose the arsenic, should any be present, by
volatilization. The residue thus obtained may then be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>submitted to a higher temperature in a subliming vessel,
in order to procure the arsenious acid in its pure
state. This process applies particularly to the examination
of the matter vomited, or the feculent evacuations
passed, by the patient. Should the arsenious
acid have, in the first instance, been dissolved in oil,
<i>Dr. Ure</i> proposes to boil the solution in distilled
water, and to separate the oil afterwards by the capillary
action of wick threads. If the arsenious acid
be mixed with resinous bodies, <i>Oil of Turpentine</i> may
be employed as their solvent, which will leave the
arsenic untouched. <i>Dr. Black</i> directed the application
of alcohol for this purpose, but this is obviously
improper, since arsenious acid is soluble in that fluid.</p>

<p class='c000'>If the physician be called upon to investigate the
contents of the alimentary canal after death, and the
arsenious acid cannot be discovered amongst the
suspected matter, the stomach itself must be cut into
small pieces, and in compliance with the directions of
<i>Orfila</i>, boiled in ten or twelve times their weight of
distilled water, which should be renewed as fast as a
portion of it flies off in vapour; this liquor should be
cooled and decanted, in order to put a few drops of
it into the solutions of the different re-agents which
we have before described. If the precipitates should
indicate the presence of arsenic, we may proceed according
to the directions we have already laid down;
if, on the other hand, the fluid offers no indication
of poison, the mass exhausted by water should be
treated, according to the process suggested by <i>Rose</i>,
by boiling it for some time in a solution of potass, by
which means the stomach will be partly decomposed
and dissolved, and the arsenious acid, with which it
might have been combined, saturated by the alkali.
In this state the liquor is to be filtered, again boiled,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>and nitric acid added, little by little, until it passes
from a dark to a clear yellow colour. The object of
the acid in this stage of the process being to decompose
and destroy the animal matter. The excess of
acid should be saturated with potass, when an <i>Arsenite
of Potass</i> will be formed, if there really existed
any arsenious acid in the stomach. This <i>M. Orfila</i>
recommends us to precipitate by the <i>Hydro-sulphuret
of Ammonia</i>, and a few drops of nitric acid; (<i>Rose</i>
prefers <i>lime water</i> for the same purpose); a yellow <i>sulphuret
of Arsenic</i> will be the result, from which the
whole of the metal may be obtained, by drying it
upon a filter, mixing it with an equal bulk of potass,
and melting it in a small glass tube.</p>

<p class='c000'>This complicated mode of proceeding will rarely
be found necessary; but it should not be neglected,
where the presence of arsenic cannot be otherwise
detected in the alimentary canal of those who are
suspected to have died from its ingestion, especially
in the examination of a body where, from the length
of time it may have been under ground, there is reason
to suppose that the acid exists in a state of intimate
combination with the animal matter. And we
may take this opportunity to observe, that advanced
putrefaction, however disagreeable it may render
such researches, will not, in the case of arsenic, defeat
their success; let the forensic physician, then,
remember, that the length of time which may have
elapsed since the death of the body, ought never to
be urged as a plea for not having proceeded in its
dissection. The task may be personally disagreeable,
but it will be less painful than the reflections which
must attend a breach of duty; upon such an occasion
we would address the anatomist in the quaint but expressive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>words of <i>Teichmeyer</i><a id='r262' /><a href='#f262' class='c011'><sup>[262]</sup></a>, “<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Præstat enim
manus quam conscientiam cruentare et contaminare.</span></i>”</p>

<h5 class='c016'><span class='sc'>Arsenic Acid</span>, and <span class='sc'>its Salts</span>.</h5>

<p class='c014'>It has been stated, that the Metal Arsenic is susceptible
of two degrees of oxidizement, the result of
its first degree being Arseni<em>ous</em> acid, and that of its
second Arsen<em>ic</em> acid. This latter compound, of which
we are now to treat, may be obtained by the repeated
distillation of white arsenic with nitric acid.
In a solid state it is white, not crystallizable; of a
sour, and at the same time, metallic taste; its specific
gravity is 3·391; when exposed to the action of
heat in a close vessel, it does not become volatile,
but melts and vitrifies; thrown on burning coals, it
swells, parts with its water, and becomes opaque; if
the process of deoxidation be continued, it will, at
length, rise in vapours, like those of arsenious acid,
and which, like them, will yield an alliaceous odour,
or not, according to the circumstances already explained.
The <i>Arsenic acid</i> dissolves very readily in
water, and is even indeed deliquescent. With alkalies,
earths, and oxides, it constitutes a class of
salts, called “<i>Arseniates</i>,” all of which, as well as
the pure acid, are extremely active poisons; fortunately,
however, they are not much employed<a id='r263' /><a href='#f263' class='c011'><sup>[263]</sup></a> in
this country, and are not likely to become the instruments
of crime. These salts, like those of the arsenious
acid, are obedient to the different re-agents
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>which were enumerated under the consideration of
this latter substance, but with different results; thus
the <i>silver</i> test, instead of producing the yellow indication,
occasions an equally characteristic precipitate
of a red, or brick colour. The ammoniuret, and
acetate of copper, furnish a bluish-white precipitate.
The arsenic acid, in a solid form, or the arseniate,
mixed with black flux, will, like white arsenic,
furnish a metallic sublimate, when heated in a
glass tube.</p>

<h5 class='c016'><span class='sc'>The Sulphurets of Arsenic.</span></h5>

<p class='c014'>There are two Sulphurets of Arsenic: the yellow
variety known in commerce under the name of <i>Orpiment</i>,
and the red sulphuret, termed <i>Realgar</i>. The
bodies, as they occur <i>native</i>, do not appear to be endowed
with the virulent powers which distinguish
the other compounds of arsenic. <i>M. Renault</i><a id='r264' /><a href='#f264' class='c011'><sup>[264]</sup></a> gave
as much as two drachms of the native orpiment to
dogs of different sizes, from which they experienced
no inconvenience. <i>Hoffman</i><a id='r265' /><a href='#f265' class='c011'><sup>[265]</sup></a> also offers his testimony
of the inertness of this substance. The same
observations apply to the <i>Realgar</i>. It is not a little
singular that while these native sulphurets of arsenic
should be so harmless, those which are produced by
artificial fusions, are extremely virulent in very
small doses. <i>M. Renault</i> supposed that this remarkable
difference of effect was owing to the arsenic
being oxidized in the latter compound, and in its
metallic state in the former. This explanation, however,
is not considered as satisfactory by <i>M. Orfila</i>,
who states that it does not embrace all the varieties
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>of the case, for that the <i>sulphuret</i>, which is artificially
obtained by pouring the arsenious acid into a solution
of sulphuretted hydrogen, is as inert as the native
compounds; besides which, chemical analysis has
proved that there is no oxygen in any of these <i>sulphurets</i>,
and that they only differ from one another, by a
greater or less proportion of their two ingredients.
This apparent anomaly induced <i>M. Orfila</i> to institute
a series of experiments for its investigation, but the
results which he has obtained are too unsatisfactory
to enable him to decide the question.</p>

<p class='c000'>The presence of an <i>Arsenical Sulphuret</i> is to be
sought for by calcination with caustic potass, in a small
glass tube. The sulphuret is decomposed in a few
seconds, yielding its sulphur to the potass, while its
metallic element is volatilized with the usual phenomena.</p>

<h4 class='c016'><span class='sc'>Mercury.</span></h4>

<p class='c014'>Mercury, or Quicksilver<a id='r266' /><a href='#f266' class='c011'><sup>[266]</sup></a>, was known in the
earliest ages. Its external characters are too familiar
to require any particular description in this place.
Its specific gravity is 13·568.<a id='r267' /><a href='#f267' class='c011'><sup>[267]</sup></a> In its metallic state
it exerts no action on the living system, except that
which may depend upon its mechanical properties,
although a different opinion has been entertained,
(see <cite>Pharmacologia</cite>, art. Hydrargyrum.)</p>

<p class='c000'>Several of the combinations of this metal are, however,
highly destructive in small doses, and are consequently
objects of forensic interest.</p>

    <div><i>Oxy-muriate of Mercury. Bi-chloride of Mercury.</i></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>This metallic salt is by far the most active of all the
mercurial preparations. According to the latest
views of Chemistry it is a compound of two proportionals
of chlorine, and one proportional of metallic
mercury, and is therefore a <i>bi-chloride of Mercury</i>.
It generally occurs in the form of a crystalline mass,
made up of very small prismatic crystals, which undergo
a slight alteration by exposure to air, becoming
opaque and pulverulent. Its taste is extremely
acrid, with a metallic astringency, occasioning a sensation
of obstruction in the throat which continues for
some time. Its specific gravity is 5·1398<a id='r268' /><a href='#f268' class='c011'><sup>[268]</sup></a>. When
pulverised and thrown upon burning coals, it is immediately
volatilized, giving out a thick white smoke,
of a very pungent smell, not at all resembling garlic,
but which irritates the mucous membranes extremely,
and is highly dangerous to those who breathe it. It
is soluble in eleven parts of cold, and in three of
boiling water; and this solubility may be farther increased
by the addition of a few drops of rectified spirit,
or of muriatic acid. When swallowed in small
quantities it acts as a most virulent poison.<a id='r269' /><a href='#f269' class='c011'><sup>[269]</sup></a></p>

<h6 class='c016'><i>Symptoms of Poisoning by Corrosive Sublimate.</i></h6>

<p class='c014'>The effects, as well as the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">modus operandi</span></i>, of this
salt, will vary with the quantity swallowed. We
shall, therefore, first consider the acute symptoms
which supervene a dose sufficiently powerful to destroy
life in a few hours; and afterwards those which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>may arise from its long continued use in small quantities,
and at different intervals.</p>

<p class='c000'>1. <i>Symptoms which follow a large dose.</i> A most
painful burning and sense of constriction is experienced
in the fauces; dryness of the mouth and lips;
excruciating pain in the stomach and bowels, increased
by the slightest pressure, and generally attended
with considerable distention; excessive vomiting
and purging of frothy mucus; the countenance is
frequently red and swollen, and the eyes exhibit a
sparkling appearance, accompanied by contraction of
the pupils. The pulse is in general quick, small,
and hard; suppression of urine takes place, and
cold sweats; anxiety; universal pains; convulsions,
and death. If the patient survives long enough, a
violent ptyalism, and sloughing of the mouth and
gums may take place.</p>

<p class='c000'>2. <i>Symptoms which are produced by the repetition of
small doses.</i> In this case the mercurial salt acts as
an “Accumulative Poison.” (<i>See page</i> <a href='#Page_148'>148</a>). The
most striking of the symptoms are those arising from
its specific action upon the salivary glands, in consequence
of which an increased flow of saliva takes
place, the gums become tender and sore, the breath
intolerably offensive, and if the use of the salt be not
discontinued, the teeth loosen, and even fall out, and
their loss is sometimes followed by that of the bones
of the palate, or maxillæ; at the same time other
evils, although perhaps less apparent, soon arise;
the strength and muscular powers of the body begin
to fail; emaciation proceeds rapidly; cardialgia, dyspepsia,
diarrhæa, and a train of morbid symptoms
succeed; violent pains are experienced in the muscles,
tendons, or joints; tremors of the limbs, and
even paralysis may result; and in some cases, pulmonary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>consumption terminates the existence of the
unhappy sufferer. It has been asserted that <i>Corrosive
Sublimate</i>, when taken for a long time in small
quantities, will sometimes occasion all the symptoms
of debility above enumerated, together with hectic
fever, without producing salivation. This is a truth
which the author’s personal experience will enable
him to confirm. The Countess of Soissons, mother
of the celebrated Prince Eugene, was accused, at
the latter end of the seventeenth century, of having
destroyed her husband by these means. A question
of considerable importance has arisen, with regard
to the specific effects of mercury, which demands
some notice in this place. <i>Whether salivation, after
having entirely subsided, can ever return without a
fresh exhibition of Mercury?</i> Two instances are related
by <i>Dr. Mead</i> of the return of salivation, after
an interval of several months, when not a particle of
mercury had been administered, in any form, during
that period.<a id='r270' /><a href='#f270' class='c011'><sup>[270]</sup></a> <i>Dr. Male</i>, in his work on Juridical
Medicine,<a id='r271' /><a href='#f271' class='c011'><sup>[271]</sup></a> relates an analogous case which occurred
in his own practice: “In March, 1815,” says he,
“I gave a small quantity of triturated mercury to a
respectable woman in this town, who had been long
ill; she became suddenly and unexpectedly salivated.
She soon recovered, and enjoyed better
health than she had done for a considerable time. In
October, without (as she informed me) having taken
any medicine whatever, the salivation returned with
extreme violence, her mouth sloughed and mortified;
and in a few weeks she died.” <i>Dr. Hamilton</i>, the
Professor of Midwifery in Edinburgh, relates in his
lectures the case of a married lady, who had been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>under the necessity of going through a course of mercury,
under the care of the late <i>Mr. Bennet</i>, who,
from motives of delicacy did not enquire very minutely
into the particular circumstances; but, according
to the rule of the day, gave his patient a sore
mouth. Four months afterwards she miscarried, and
salivation again came on. It was removed for a week,
at the end of which it returned, and harrassed her for
about twelve months.<a id='r272' /><a href='#f272' class='c011'><sup>[272]</sup></a> The author, in his <cite>Pharmacologia</cite>,<a id='r273' /><a href='#f273' class='c011'><sup>[273]</sup></a>
has cited a case from <cite>Hufeland’s Journal</cite>,
(vol. ix) wherein mercurial influence, after its
complete subsidence, had been renewed by doses of
opium. In the trial of <i>Miss Butterfield</i>, at the Croydon
assizes, for poisoning <i>Mr. Scawen</i>, in the year
1775, the merit of the case entirely hinged upon this
question. See vol. 1, p. 303.</p>

<h6 class='c016'><i>Physiological action of Corrosive Sublimate.</i></h6>

<p class='c014'>When this salt is introduced into the stomach in a
large dose, it immediately exerts a corrosive action
on that organ, in consequence of which the heart
and brain become sympathetically affected, and death
results from the suspension of their functions. For
this view of the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">modus operandi</span></i> of this mercurial salt
we are indebted to <i>Mr. Brodie</i>,<a id='r274' /><a href='#f274' class='c011'><sup>[274]</sup></a> whence it would
appear that its physiological action is very different
from that of arsenious acid; the former acting as a
simple <i>escharotic</i>, on the coats of the alimentary canal,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>the latter requiring to be absorbed, before it can
display its energies. These observations, however,
apply only to those cases in which the quantity of
poison has been so considerable as to destroy life in a
few hours; where the dose has been small, and the
symptoms have arisen from its frequent repetition,
the salt produces its effects by a different mode of
operation. In this latter case it is absorbed, and
carried into the current of the blood, so as to be distributed
to every part of the living system; and it has
been asserted that, after the long continued and improper
use of mercury, it has been discovered in different
parts of the body, and even in the brain, in
the form of globules. In this way then deleterious
effects may arise from the external application of corrosive
sublimate, and numerous instances are recorded
where such consequences have followed the
injudicious use of lotions and plasters, into which it had
entered as an ingredient.<a id='r275' /><a href='#f275' class='c011'><sup>[275]</sup></a> In the <cite>Medical Repository</cite>,
for December, 1821, <i>Mr. Sutleffe</i> has communicated
the case of a girl of five years of age, who became
salivated, and died, in consequence of an application
made to the head for <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">tinea capitis</span></i>, consisting
of pomatum rubbed up with a few grains of <i>corrosive
sublimate</i>.</p>

<h6 class='c016'><i>Antidotes to Corrosive Sublimate.</i></h6>

<p class='c014'>After the view which we have taken of the operation
of this salt in large doses, it necessarily follows
that copious dilution is the very first object which we
have to accomplish, and then the ejection of the fluid
by vomiting. <i>Sydenham</i> relates an interesting case of
poisoning by this substance, which was successfully
treated by copious draughts of water, and repeated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>vomiting.<a id='r276' /><a href='#f276' class='c011'><sup>[276]</sup></a> But it becomes a question of great
practical importance to enquire, whether there may
not exist some counterpoison or antidote which, by
decomposing the salt, will at once disarm it of its virulence?
This question has been investigated in a very
masterly style by <i>Orfila</i>, who has clearly proved by
experiment, that neither the <i>alkaline salts</i> and <i>earths,
the sulphurets of potass and of lime</i>, nor the <i>martial
alkaline tinctures</i>, as proposed by <i>Navier</i>,<a id='r277' /><a href='#f277' class='c011'><sup>[277]</sup></a> deserve
the least confidence; for although the salt may by
some of these bodies be decomposed, yet the resulting
oxide will prove as virulent as the original compound;
equally inefficient are the other substances which
have been proposed as counter-poisons, such as <i>sulphuretted
hydrogen</i>, <i>solutions of sugar</i>,<a id='r278' /><a href='#f278' class='c011'><sup>[278]</sup></a> <i>the infusions
of Peruvian bark</i>,<a id='r279' /><a href='#f279' class='c011'><sup>[279]</sup></a> and <i>metallic mercury</i>.<a id='r280' /><a href='#f280' class='c011'><sup>[280]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'><i>M. Orfila</i> having observed the facility with which
<i>albumen</i> decomposes corrosive sublimate, and gives
rise to a triple compound of albumen, muriatic acid,
and protoxide of mercury, induced him to ascertain
by experiments whether the <i>white of eggs</i> might not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>prove an antidote to that poison; the result of his
inquiry has shewn that this is the case; and that by
mixing such albuminous matter, in <em>large quantities</em>,
with the diluents given to provoke vomiting, the
happiest effects may be anticipated. Many examples
are recorded of the success of this practice. In the
Transactions of the King and Queen’s College of
Physicians in Ireland, an interesting case of this kind
is related by <i>Dr. Lendrick</i>; it is, however, but justice
to state, that there are instances also of the failure
of this antidote. In the 41st volume of the <cite>London
Medical and Physical Journal</cite>, p. 204, the reader
will find the case of a girl who was poisoned by a
drachm of sublimate, and who, notwithstanding the
copious administration of albumen, died in ninety
hours afterwards.</p>

<p class='c000'>It has lately been discovered that vegetable <i>gluten</i>,
as existing in wheat flour, is capable of producing
upon corrosive sublimate the same chemical decomposition,
as that which we have stated to arise from
the action of albumen; whence the administration of
wheat flour and water has been suggested as a ready
antidote. On the trial of <i>Michael Whiting</i>, for administering
poison (<i>corrosive sublimate</i>) to his brothers-in-law,
<i>George</i> and <i>Joseph Langman</i>, the housekeeper,
<i>Catharine Carter</i>, stated in evidence, that the
flour, (which was subsequently proved to contain
corrosive sublimate) could scarcely be made into
dumplings with milk<a id='r281' /><a href='#f281' class='c011'><sup>[281]</sup></a>; and another witness, <i>Mrs.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>Hopkins</i>, a neighbour who took charge of the dumpling
that had not been boiled, described it as “<em>a comical
sort of paste; like glazier’s putty more than
paste, though not greasy</em>.” In order to ascertain the
correctness of this statement, we mixed powdered
sublimate with wheat flour, and proceeded to make it
into dough with milk; when the same difficulty as
that stated by the above witnesses, embarrassed the
process, and satisfied us of the truth of their testimony.
The phenomenon would appear to depend
upon the mutual chemical changes which arise in the
gluten and mercurial salt.</p>

<h6 class='c016'><i>Organic Lesions discovered on Dissection.</i></h6>

<p class='c014'>The œsophagus and stomach will be found inflamed,
and sometimes eroded, as in poisoning by
arsenic. <i>Salin</i> has asserted, that this salt never produces
perforation of the intestinal tube; this, however,
is not the fact; and we know not of any exclusive
appearances, by which the organic lesions inflicted
by this poison can be distinguished, unless
indeed it be the black appearance of the stomach, as

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>
  <h6 class='c016'><i>Of the Chemical Processes by which the presence of Corrosive Sublimate may be detected.</i></h6>
</div>

<p class='c014'>As the chemist, devoted to forensic enquiry, will
be required to identify this substance under very
different states of mixture and combination, we shall
proceed to enumerate the various obstacles that may
possibly oppose his researches; and, at the same
time, to suggest the expedients by which they may
be successfully evaded. Unlike arsenious acid, corrosive
sublimate is so readily decomposed by various
alimentary substances, that, when we attempt to demonstrate
its presence in such mixtures, we shall be
more frequently compelled to rest our proof upon
the products of the analysis, than upon the actual reproduction
of the salt.</p>

<p class='c000'>We shall proceed to consider the best modes of
establishing the presence of this salt, in the different
forms in which it may occur, viz. 1, <i>In the solid
form</i>; 2, <i>Dissolved in water or spirit</i>; 3, <i>In various
coloured liquids</i>; 4, <i>In a state of mixture with various
solids</i>; 5, <i>Combined with solid or liquid aliments, by
which it undergoes decomposition</i>; 6, <i>In a state of combination
with the textures of the alimentary canal</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>1. <i>The sublimate is in its solid form.</i> The external
characters by which this salt is distinguished will go
far to establish its identity; but the fact should always
receive the support of a chemical proof; and
as this is to be derived from the phenomena afforded
by its solutions through the intervention of various
tests, it will meet with full consideration in the following
section, viz.</p>

<p class='c000'>2. <i>The salt is in the state of solution, in water, or
spirit.</i> Let us then suppose that we have a solution
of some body in distilled water, which we suspect to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>be corrosive sublimate, by what means are we able to
identify it?</p>

<p class='c000'>(<i>a</i>) <i>By its metallization, through the agency of
galvanism.</i> We are indebted to <i>Mr. Sylvester</i> for first
suggesting the mode by which galvanic electricity
might be applied for the detection of minute quantities
of corrosive sublimate in solution. His method
is as follows. A piece of zinc or iron wire, about
three inches in length, is to be twice bent at right
angles, so as to resemble the greek letter π, the two
legs of this figure should be distant about the diameter
of a common wedding ring from each other, and the
two ends of the bent wire must afterwards be tied to
a ring of this description. Let a plate of glass, not
less than three inches square, be laid as nearly horizontal
as possible, and on one side drop some sulphuric
acid, diluted with about six times its weight of
water, till it spreads to the size of a halfpenny. At a
little distance from this, towards the other side, next
drop some of the solution supposed to contain corrosive
sublimate, till the edges of the two liquids become
joined; and let the wire and ring, prepared as
above, be laid in such a way, that the wire may touch
the acid, while the gold ring is in contact with the
suspected liquid. If the minutest quantity of corrosive
sublimate be present, the ring, in a few minutes,
will be covered with metallic mercury on the part
which touched the fluid.</p>

<p class='c000'>The above experiment may be beautifully simplified
in the following manner<a id='r282' /><a href='#f282' class='c011'><sup>[282]</sup></a>. Drop a small quantity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>of a solution, supposed to contain the salt in
question, on a piece of gold, and bring into contact
a key, or some piece of iron, so as to form a galvanic
circuit; when, if sublimate be present, the gold will
immediately be whitened.</p>

<p class='c000'>A solution of <i>nitrate of silver</i> will, under similar
treatment, occasion on gold a white precipitate; but
as no amalgamation takes place, it is readily wiped
off, and cannot therefore occasion any fallacy.</p>

<p class='c000'>(<i>b</i>) <i>By precipitating metallic mercury from its solution,
by the contact of a single metal.</i> It should be
generally known that, by virtue of superior affinity,
certain metals will decompose the solution of corrosive
sublimate, with different phenomena; in those
cases where the precipitating metal is capable of forming
a direct union with mercury, we shall find the
precipitates to consist of an amalgam of the metal
employed; where no such combination takes place,
the mercury may be frequently seen standing on the
surface as a metallic dew. This is particularly striking
when iron or steel has been employed. In the
evidence given on the trial of <i>Mary Bateman</i><a id='r283' /><a href='#f283' class='c011'><sup>[283]</sup></a>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>better known by the name of the “Yorkshire Witch,”
<i>Mr. Thomas Chorley</i>, surgeon at Leeds, stated that
he had received from his assistant, <i>Mr. Hammerton</i>,
a jar which he had carefully preserved in his possession,
and of the contents of which he gave the following
account. “Upon tasting a portion, it was
very acrid, styptic, and permanent upon the tongue;
I then took a small quantity of it upon a clean knife,
and rubbed it with my finger; a change of colour
immediately appeared; <em>further rubbing produced numerous
globules of quicksilver</em>, and the knife was, at
the same time, blackened by it; this change of colour
led me to suspect that it must be a mercurial composition,
and having made a solution of it, and subjected
it to a series of tests and experiments, it is my
opinion, that the mixture in the pot did contain <em>honey</em>,
and <i>corrosive sublimate of mercury</i>. In order, however,
more fully to satisfy myself upon this point, a
mixture was made of these ingredients, when it was
found to yield the same results.” In the above experiment,
the steel knife decomposed the sublimate,
forming a <i>chloride of iron</i>, while the mercury, thus
disengaged in its metallic form, being unable to amalgamate
with the iron, appeared in globules<a id='r284' /><a href='#f284' class='c011'><sup>[284]</sup></a> upon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>its surface. At the same time the knife <em>became blackened</em>
owing to the precipitation of carbonaceous matter
from the steel.</p>

<p class='c000'>(<i>c</i>) <i>Carbonate of Potass.</i> A saturated solution of
this salt, added to that of corrosive sublimate, will
produce a <i>deep brick coloured</i> sediment, which is
stated to consist of per-carbonate of mercury<a id='r285' /><a href='#f285' class='c011'><sup>[285]</sup></a>;
while a muriate of potass will be found to remain in
solution. The <i>sub-carbonate of potass</i> will occasion
a somewhat different precipitate, of a <i>clear brick</i>
colour, and consisting of a mixture of the carbonate,
and oxide of the metal.<a id='r286' /><a href='#f286' class='c011'><sup>[286]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>(<i>d</i>) <i>Ammonia.</i> A solution of the volatile alkali
produces a <i>white precipitate</i>, which is an insoluble
triple salt, composed of muriatic acid, ammonia, and
oxide of mercury; being heated it grows yellow; it
passes afterwards to red, and according to <i>Orfila</i>
gives out ammoniacal gas, nitrogen, calomel, and
metallic mercury. In this operation the oxide of
mercury is supposed to be deoxidized by the hydrogen
which results from a portion of the decomposed
ammonia.</p>

<p class='c000'>(<i>e</i>) <i>Lime water.</i> This reagent may be said to decompose
corrosive sublimate more perfectly than any
alkaline body; occasioning a precipitate of a deep
yellow colour, which will be found to be a peroxide
of mercury; unless indeed the quantity of lime water
be very small, when it will be a sub-muriate of the
peroxide.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>(<i>f</i>) <i>Nitrate of Tin.</i> According to <i>Dr. Bostock</i><a id='r287' /><a href='#f287' class='c011'><sup>[287]</sup></a>
this test is capable of detecting the three-millionth
part of a grain in solution. A single drop will produce
an immediate and copious dark-brown precipitation.</p>

<p class='c000'>All the above precipitates, if rubbed on a bright
plate of copper, will render its surface silvery white,
in consequence of the amalgamation which takes
place.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Brugnatelli</i> has lately proposed a method of distinguishing
<i>corrosive sublimate</i> from <i>arsenic</i>, which
we have repeated to our satisfaction; but the experiment
requires some nicety of manipulation to secure
its success. Take a quantity of fresh wheat starch,
mix with water, and add a sufficient quantity of <i>iodine</i>
to give the liquid a blue colour; if either of the
above poisons be now introduced into it, the colour
will be destroyed, and assume a reddish tint; but
if the change has been effected by the latter substance,
a few drops of sulphuric acid will restore the
blue colour; whereas if it has been produced by the
former, it is not recoverable by such means.<a id='r288' /><a href='#f288' class='c011'><sup>[288]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>3. <i>It is dissolved in various coloured liquids.</i> Under
this subdivision we have to consider the corrosive
sublimate as existing in a state of solution, in liquids,
whose colour will be liable to obscure the characteristic
indications which the several reagents would
otherwise occasion. It has been proposed to obviate
such impediments by the previous addition of chlorine,
which will discharge the colour in question.
<i>Orfila</i> recommends such a process, where the salt
has been dissolved in wine. The same objections
which we urged against this mode of proceeding,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>under the consideration of arsenic, appear to us to
apply to corrosive sublimate.</p>

<p class='c000'>It will be preferable on these occasions to precipitate
the salt by an appropriate reagent, and then to
assay the precipitate for metallic mercury; or to
evaporate the solution, and to submit the matter so
obtained to the process of sublimation, when the sublimate
may be dissolved in distilled water, and examined
by the tests above described. This circuitous
process may, however, in many cases be rendered
unnecessary, by dropping the solution on the surface
of white paper, and in such a situation proceeding to
its examination by tests; when the colour of the
precipitate will rarely be exposed to any optical fallacy.
The Galvanic process of metallic reduction
will also furnish a satisfactory solution of the problem.</p>

<p class='c000'>4. <i>It is mixed, or combined, with some medicinal
body in a solid form.</i> As persons have been poisoned
by empirical remedies, and other medicines containing
sublimate, <a id='acc'></a>accidentally or by design, it is necessary to
point out the readiest mode by which the investigation
may be pursued. If it should form part of a plaster,
it will be adviseable to cut it up in small pieces, and
boil them for a quarter of an hour in distilled water;
this fluid, after standing for some time, should be
filtered, and examined as we have before directed.
It is evident that, if the sublimate is neither decomposed,
nor strongly retained by the materials which
compose the plaster, it ought to be found in the
above solution; if, however, no such result can be
obtained, the solid portion should be dried in a capsule,
and mixed with potass; and in this state submitted,
in the usual manner, to the process of sublimation,
when the appearance of metallic globules
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>will announce the existence of the salt in question,
or, at least, of the presence of some mercurial preparation.</p>

<p class='c000'>5. <i>It is united with alimentary substances which have
effected its decomposition.</i> It has been frequently
stated during the course of the present inquiry, that
corrosive sublimate is easily susceptible of decomposition,
and that various alimentary substances, of
animal as well as vegetable origin, have the power
of converting it into <i>calomel</i>.<a id='r289' /><a href='#f289' class='c011'><sup>[289]</sup></a> This important fact
was first noticed by <i>Chaussier</i><a id='r290' /><a href='#f290' class='c011'><sup>[290]</sup></a> and has been more
fully investigated and confirmed by <i>Orfila</i>.<a id='r291' /><a href='#f291' class='c011'><sup>[291]</sup></a> Where
the quantity of mercurial salt has been considerable,
we may generally obtain, on washing the alimentary
matter, a sufficient portion for experiment; but
where the dose has been small, or where it has been
ejected by frequent vomiting, the whole residue may
be decomposed; in which case we must seek to establish
the fact of poisoning, through the detection of
metallic mercury, by the processes of calcination and
sublimation.</p>

<p class='c000'>6. <i>It is decomposed, and a part exists in intimate
combination with the membranes of the alimentary canal.</i>
If all the preceding experiments have failed in detecting
the presence of corrosive sublimate, it becomes
our duty to examine the textures with which
it may be supposed to have come in contact; the
coats of the canal should be cut into pieces, and
calcined with potass, when, if they have been acted
upon by sublimate, they will yield metallic mercury
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>by sublimation. “The alimentary canal,” says <i>M.
Orfila</i>, “acts upon the sublimate like all other animal
substances; muriatic acid is disengaged, and
muriate of mercury <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad minimum</span></i> (<i>calomel</i>) is formed,
which combines with the substance of the viscus.</p>

<p class='c000'>It may be objected,” continues this distinguished
experimentalist, “that this chemical action does
not take place in the living animal; that our texture,
while endued with the vital principle, is not subservient
to the same laws as inorganic substances: I am
not ignorant of the extent to which this objection
is well-founded; but admitting the justice of it, the
conclusion is not less true, that if the stomach contains
corrosive sublimate at the moment of death,
this body will, from that moment, act on the texture
of the viscus itself. If the stomach contain a large
quantity of aliment, the effects of such an action
may be scarcely perceptible; but on the contrary,
they will be easily applicable, should the viscus be
empty, and especially if the examination of the body
takes place several days after death.”<a id='r292' /><a href='#f292' class='c011'><sup>[292]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>In conducting experiments upon this, and indeed
all other mineral poisons, the chemist must be prepared
to meet with anomalies depending upon the
impurities or adulterations of the substance under
examination.</p>

<h5 class='c016'><span class='sc'>Red Oxide of Mercury.</span> <i>Precipitate per se.</i></h5>

<p class='c014'>We are not aware of any instance of death having,
from accident or design, taken place in consequence
of the administration of this substance; indeed its
red colour, insolubility in water, and comparative
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>rarity, will protect mankind sufficiently against mistake,
and at the same time render its secret administration
extremely difficult. It is, moreover, mild in
its effects, unless in large doses, or, under particular
circumstances of constitution. It may be identified
by its form, which is that of minute crystalline scales,
of a deep red colour, and by exposing it to heat in
a glass tube, by which it undergoes decomposition,
giving out metallic mercury, adhering to the sides of
the tube, and oxygen gas, which is disengaged.</p>

<h5 class='c016'><span class='sc'>Red Precipitate</span>, or <i>Nitric Oxide of Mercury</i>.</h5>

<p class='c014'>This is, strictly speaking, a <i>sub-nitrate</i> of mercury,
and is much more poisonous than the preceding substance.
<i>Plouquet</i><a id='r293' /><a href='#f293' class='c011'><sup>[293]</sup></a> relates the case of a man, who
swallowed by accident some red precipitate, when
he immediately experienced violent colics, copious
vomitings, a trembling of his limbs, and cold sweats.
Its external characters will at once enable the chemist
to identify it.</p>

<h5 class='c016'><span class='sc'>Other Preparations of Mercury.</span></h5>

<p class='c014'>The various saline compounds of this metal, as the
acetate, sulphate, and nitrate, are all highly poisonous,
but they do not appear to us to merit a separate consideration;
and more especially as we have already
explained the various processes by which every variety
of preparation may be identified. We may just
remark that the <i>sulphuret</i>, better known by the name
of <i>cinnabar</i>, or <i>vermilion</i>, has been known to occasion
deleterious effects. <i>Dr. Gordon Smith</i><a id='r294' /><a href='#f294' class='c011'><sup>[294]</sup></a> states,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>upon the authority of <i>Mr. Accum</i>,<a id='r295' /><a href='#f295' class='c011'><sup>[295]</sup></a> that “Vermilion
has been detected as a poisonous ingredient in
cheese:” this may be very true, but he should have
stated at the same time, that the deleterious effects
produced by it, did not arise from the mercurial sulphuret,
but from the red lead with which it happened
to be adulterated; and it is necessary to acquaint the
forensic chemist, that such a fraud<a id='r296' /><a href='#f296' class='c011'><sup>[296]</sup></a> is by no means
uncommon; it may be very easily detected by burning
a small portion of the suspected sample on a piece
of bread in the candle, when metallic globules will
announce the presence of lead; for the oxide of mercury,
although revived by the process, will at the
same time be volatilized. The bread by combustion
affords the carbon by which the metallic reduction
is effected.</p>

<p class='c000'>The presence of very minute quantities of <i>vermilion</i>
may, according to <i>Mr. Smithson</i>, be detected by the
following simple experiment. Boil a portion with
sulphuric acid in a platina spoon, and lay the sulphate
thus produced in a drop of muriatic acid, on a
piece of gold, and then bring a piece of metallic tin
in contact with both, when the white mercurial stain
will be produced.</p>

“<i>Currus Triumphalis Antimonii</i>,” which was published
towards the end of the 15th century, we are indebted
for almost all our knowledge respecting this metal.</p>

<p class='c000'>Antimony is of a greyish white colour, having considerable
brilliancy; its texture is laminated, and
exhibits plates crossing each other in every direction;
its <i>specific gravity</i> is 6·7021; when rubbed upon the
fingers it communicates to them a peculiar taste and
smell; it is very brittle, and fuses at the temperature
of 809°, but does not appear to be volatile; when
fused, with the access of air, it emits white fumes,
consisting of an oxide of the metal, which formerly
was called <i>Argentine flowers of Antimony</i>. When
the metal is raised to a white heat, and suddenly
agitated, it enters into a state of combustion, and is
converted into the same white coloured oxide.</p>

<p class='c000'>According to <i>Thenard</i>,<a id='r298' /><a href='#f298' class='c011'><sup>[298]</sup></a> antimony is susceptible
of no less than six different degrees of oxidation;
<i>Proust</i>, however, has shewn that they may all be reduced
to two, viz. <i>protoxide</i> and <i>peroxide</i>. The former
of which alone exerts any sensible activity upon
the human body; but this constitutes the basis of
several preparations, which although in common use
for medical purposes, are so extremely poisonous in
larger doses, as to render them objects of interest to
the forensic physician.</p>

</div>

<p class='c014'>This saline body appears in the state of white
crystals, whose primitive figure is the regular tetrahedron,
although it assumes a variety of secondary
forms. Its chemical composition is still involved in
some obscurity; it is stated, in the different dispensatories,
to be a triple salt, consisting of tartaric acid,
oxide of antimony, and potass, and that it ought
therefore, according to the principles of the reformed
nomenclature, to be termed a <i>Tartrate of Antimony
and Potass</i>. The truth of these views, however, we
have already<a id='r300' /><a href='#f300' class='c011'><sup>[300]</sup></a> ventured to question; <i>Gay Lussac</i>
has stated that in the various metalline compounds
of which <i>Super-tartrate of Potass</i> is an ingredient,
this latter substance acts the part of a simple acid;
an opinion which receives considerable support from
the great solvent property of <i>cream of tartar</i>, and
from the striking fact that it is even capable of dissolving
various oxides which are insoluble in tartaric
acid, of which the protoxide of antimony is an example.
In such a state of doubt, a better name could
not be found than that of <i>tartarized antimony</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>The salt, according to <i>Dr. Duncan</i>, is soluble in
three times its weight of distilled water at 212° <i>Fah.</i>
and in fifteen, at 60°.</p>

<p class='c000'>When it is heated red hot in an earthen crucible, it
blackens, and undergoes decomposition like a vegetable
body, leaving a residuum of metallic antimony,
and slightly carbonated potass.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>
  <h6 class='c016'><i>Symptoms of Poisoning by Emetic Tartar.</i></h6>
</div>

<p class='c014'>A question has arisen whether this salt can be considered
as a poison, capable of occasioning death? In
general where a large dose has been administered, it
is all rejected by the vomiting which it excites; we
accordingly find in the works of <i>Morgagni</i> and other
pathologists, the history of various cases in proof of
the innocence of this salt. <i>Hoffman</i>, however, relates
the case of a woman who experienced very
severe symptoms shortly after having taken tartar
emetic, and that she ultimately died,<a id='r301' /><a href='#f301' class='c011'><sup>[301]</sup></a> and there
are other similar instances recorded in the works of
<i>Foderé</i> and <i>Orfila</i>. It also deserves notice, that tartarized
antimony is very liable to produce deleterious
effects, where, from the insensibility of the nervous
system, the operation of vomiting cannot be excited,
as in apoplexy, drunkenness, and in that state of
coma, which follows the ingestion of narcotic vegetables.
<i>M. Cloquet</i> communicated to <i>Orfila</i> a case
highly illustrative of this fact, in which a person,
labouring under apoplexy, received into his stomach
more than forty grains of tartar emetic, without exciting
either nausea or vomiting. On opening the
body, independent of the morbid state of the brain,
which must be regarded as the immediate cause of
death, extensive organic lesions were discovered in
the alimentary canal, which could alone be attributed
to the action of the tartar emetic. This fact will
suggest a very important precaution to the practitioner,
who may be called upon to treat a person
labouring under a state of the system which will prevent
the act of vomiting.<a id='r302' /><a href='#f302' class='c011'><sup>[302]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>The symptoms produced by this salt will resemble
those of a corrosive poison; and where vomiting is
produced, it frequently happens that although the
patient may be eventually saved, an irritability of
stomach, so great as to cause the rejection of all aliments,
will remain for a considerable period; and
<i>Dr. Male</i> states that in the only case of poisoning by
this salt which he had ever seen, the person was
affected with violent convulsions, which returned at
intervals for several weeks after recovery from the
immediate effects of the poison.<a id='r303' /><a href='#f303' class='c011'><sup>[303]</sup></a> <i>M. Orfila</i>, after
detailing several cases of poisoning by emetic tartar,
concludes by saying that the general symptoms, upon
such occasions, may be reduced to the following:
a rough metallic taste; nausea; copious vomitings;
frequent hiccup; cardialgia; burning heat in the epigastric
region; pains of the stomach; abdominal colics;
inflation; copious stools; syncope; small, contracted
and accelerated pulse; skin cold, sometimes
intensely hot; breathing difficult; vertigo, loss of
sense, convulsive movements; very painful cramps in
the legs; prostration of strength,—death.</p>

<p class='c000'>Sometimes to the above symptoms is joined a great
difficulty of swallowing; deglutition may be suspended
for some time. The vomiting and alvine evacuations
do not always take place, the necessary consequence
of which is an increase in the violence of the other
symptoms.</p>

<h6 class='c016'><i>Antidotes.</i></h6>

<p class='c014'>The great indication to be fulfilled in a case of this
description, is the ejection of the salt by vomiting.
<i>MM. Orfila</i> and <i>Berthollet</i> rely very confidently upon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>the effects of <i>bark</i>, <i>strong tea</i>, <i>infusion of galls</i>, and
other <i>vegetable astringents</i>, which have undoubtedly
the power of decomposing the salt. They ought,
therefore, to be employed as diluents to assist vomiting,
but they are not to be considered as antidotes
which can render this latter operation less indispensable.</p>

<h6 class='c016'><i>Physiological action of emetic tartar.</i></h6>

<p class='c014'><i>M. Majendie</i> has shewn by experiment, that if
<i>tartarized antimony</i> be injected into the veins of a dog,
the animal vomits, and has frequent stools; his
breathing becomes difficult; his pulse frequent and
intermitting; a great degree of disquietude, and
tremblings are the precursory signs of death, which
generally takes place within the first hour from the
injection of the emetic tartar. On opening the body
great alterations are perceived in the lungs; they are
found of an orange or violet colour, have no crackling,
are distended with blood, and of a tight texture.
The mucous membrane of the intestinal canal, from
the cardia to the extremity of the rectum is red, and
strongly injected.</p>

<p class='c000'>If, instead of thus injecting the emetic tartar into
the veins, it be injected into the stomach, and the
œsophagus is tied to prevent vomiting, <i>M. Orfila</i> informs
us that the same alterations will be found after
death. The very same effects will also arise from the
application of the emetic tartar to the different absorbing
surfaces, such as the cellular substances, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Mr. Brodie</i><a id='r304' /><a href='#f304' class='c011'><sup>[304]</sup></a> has also thrown considerable light
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>upon the action of this salt. He observes that the
effects of emetic tartar so much resemble those of
<i>arsenic</i>, which we have already described, and those
of <i>muriate of baryta</i>, which will form a future subject
of inquiry, that it would be needless to enter into a
detail of the individual experiments which he made
with it. When applied to a wound in animals which
are capable of vomiting, it usually, but not constantly,
operated very speedily as an emetic; in other respects
he found no material difference in the symptoms
produced in the different species of animals,
which he had been in the habit of employing as subjects
of experiment. The symptoms were paralysis,
drowsiness, and, at last, complete insensibility; the
pulse became feeble, but the heart continued to act
after apparent death, and was maintained in action
by means of artificial respiration; but never for a
longer period than for a few minutes. Whence it
would appear, that this poison acts by being absorbed,
and that it directs a sedative influence upon the
heart, as well as the brain, but that its principal action
is on the latter. The length of time which
elapses, from the application of the poison to the death
of the animal, varies; in some instances <i>Mr. Brodie</i>
found that it did not exceed three quarters of an
hour, but in others, it was two or three hours, or
even longer, before death took place. When a solution
of emetic tartar was injected into the stomach of
a rabbit, <i>Mr. Brodie</i> observed the same symptoms to
take place, as when it was applied to a wound.</p>

<h6 class='c016'><i>Organic lesions discovered by dissection.</i></h6>

<p class='c014'><i>Mr. Brodie</i>, in his examination of animals poisoned
by <i>emetic tartar</i>, sometimes found the stomach
bearing the marks of inflammation, but at other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>times, its appearance was perfectly natural. In no
case did he discover any traces of inflammation in the
intestines. The reader must compare this account
with that already given by <i>M. Majendie</i>, at p. <a href='#Page_282'>282</a>.</p>

<h6 class='c016'>1. <i>Tests for the detection of emetic tartar.</i></h6>

<p class='c014'>1. <i>The poison is in a solid form.</i> Dissolve a portion
of the suspected salt in about fifteen times its
weight of boiling distilled water; if it be emetic tartar,
the following reagents will identify it, viz.</p>

<p class='c000'>(<i>a</i>) <i>The hydrosulphurets</i> will occasion a reddish-yellow
precipitate, which is a combination of <i>oxygen</i>
and <i>antimony</i>, proceeding from the emetic tartar;
and of <i>hydrogen</i> and <i>sulphur</i>, from the reagent employed.
If it be dried on a filter, and mixed with
charcoal and the potass of commerce, it gives, by
the action of heat, a cake of metallic antimony.</p>

<p class='c000'>(<i>b</i>) <i>Tincture of galls.</i> This is regarded as the most
sensible test of this salt, affording a precipitate of a
curdled, dirty white colour, inclining to yellow.</p>

<p class='c000'>(<i>c</i>) <i>Lime water.</i> This reagent produces a white
precipitate, which is extremely thick, and is easily
redissolved by pure nitric acid. In this case the lime
forms an insoluble tartrate, and the tartrate of antimony,
thus rendered insoluble, subsides along with it.</p>

<p class='c000'>(<i>d</i>) <i>Concentrated sulphuric acid</i> gives a white precipitate,
which consists of the oxide of antimony retaining
a small portion of the acid. It redissolves in
an excess of the precipitant.</p>

<p class='c000'>(<i>e</i>) <i>Vegetable extractive</i>, occasions in the solution
of this salt, a reddish-yellow precipitate, which
has been found to consist of <i>oxide of antimony</i>, and a
portion of vegetable matter.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>
  <h6 class='c016'>2. <i>It is mixed with various alimentary substances.</i></h6>
</div>

<p class='c014'>If our attempts should fail to procure a solution of the
salt by filtration, answering to the above reagents,
we must rely upon the proof of metallic reproduction.
Various circumstances may invalidate the action of
our tests, such, for instance, as the ingestion of some
vegetable infusion or decoction, especially that of
galls, or yellow bark.</p>

<p class='c000'>With respect to the other preparations of antimony,
it is unnecessary to waste our time in their
consideration; the precepts already given will afford
the practitioner every requisite hint for the prosecution
of the enquiry.</p>

<h4 class='c016'><span class='sc'>Copper.</span></h4>

<p class='c014'>This metal, with the exception of gold and silver,
and perhaps tin, was known earlier than any other
metal; but its applications were entirely confined to
the arts. It was first discovered by the Greeks in the
island of Cyprus, whence its name; and we learn
from <i>Homer</i>, that even during the Trojan war, the
combatants had no other armour but what was made
of bronze, which is a mixture of <i>copper</i> and <i>tin</i>.<a id='r305' /><a href='#f305' class='c011'><sup>[305]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c000'>The external characters of the metal are too well
known to require minute description. Its taste is
styptic and nauseous; and the hands when rubbed
for some time on it, acquire a peculiar and disagreeable
odour. When melted, its specific gravity is
8·667; but after being hammered it is 8·9. It is only
susceptible of two degrees of oxidation. If the protoxide
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>be <em>native</em>, it is red; if <em>artificial</em>, orange coloured.
The peroxide is black.</p>

<p class='c000'>Copper, on exposure to a moist atmosphere, becomes
tarnished, absorbs a portion of its oxygen, and
passes into the state of an oxide, which shortly unites
with the carbonic acid of the atmosphere, and forms
a greenish carbonate of copper.</p>

<p class='c000'>Metallic copper, perfectly pure, does not possess
any deleterious properties. We have already cited
instances<a id='r306' /><a href='#f306' class='c011'><sup>[306]</sup></a> sufficiently conclusive to establish this
fact. It becomes, therefore, a subject of no little interest
to enquire, under what circumstances it may
become poisonous by combination. <i>M. Orfila</i> observes
that it has been long maintained, that milk
heated, or allowed to remain in vessels of copper not
oxidized, dissolved a portion of this metal, and acted
as a poison. <i>Eller</i>, a philosopher of Berlin, has,
however, very clearly proved such an opinion to be
incorrect. He boiled in succession, in a kettle well
freed from verdegris, milk, tea, coffee, beer, and
rain water; after two hours boiling, he found it impossible
to discover, in any of these fluids, the least
vestige of copper. <i>M. Drouard</i> has also shewn that
distilled water, left for a month together on the
filings of this metal in a glass bottle, did not dissolve
an atom of it. The celebrated toxicologist above
cited, after relating these important facts, concludes
by observing, that the phenomena are very different,
if, instead of pure water, we substitute that which contains
a certain quantity of muriate of soda. <i>Eller</i> has
demonstrated the presence of a very small quantity of
copper in water, which contained 1/20th of its weight of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>muriate of soda, and which had been boiled in a brass
kettle. This fact is of the highest importance, for it will
explain the reason why highly seasoned aliments have
proved deleterious, when cooked in vessels of copper.
But we are indebted to <i>Mr. Eller</i> for a still more important
discovery; he found that if, instead of heating
a simple solution of common salt in copper vessels, the
salt be previously mixed with beef, bacon, and fish,
the fluid resulting from it does not contain an atom
of copper.<a id='r307' /><a href='#f307' class='c011'><sup>[307]</sup></a> In relating this fact, <i>M. Orfila</i> observes,
“however astonishing it may appear, it is
quite correct, <i>M. Eller</i> was the first to announce it,
and I have several times ascertained the truth of it;
it is probable,” continues <i>Orfila</i>, “that the combination
of several kinds of aliments destroys the effect of
the solution of the muriate of soda; which consequently
ought to render the cases of poisoning by aliments
cooked in copper vessels, <em>which are not oxidized</em>,
extremely rare.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Copper combines with sulphur, and affords a black
sulphuret.</p>

<h5 class='c016'><span class='sc'>Oxide of Copper.</span></h5>

<p class='c014'>By oxidation, copper becomes poisonous. The
substance may be easily recognised by the change of
colour which it produces in ammonia; this alkali will
dissolve it instantly, and assume a beautiful blue
colour. It is wholly insoluble<a id='r308' /><a href='#f308' class='c011'><sup>[308]</sup></a> in water. In oils
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>and fatty matter it is easily and copiously dissolved at
the ordinary temperature of the atmosphere. Such
bodies also, when boiled in vessels of perfectly clean
copper, facilitate their oxidation, especially if left to
cool a few minutes before they are poured out.</p>

<h5 class='c016'><span class='sc'>Green Carbonate of Copper</span>—<i>Natural Verdegris</i>.</h5>

<p class='c014'>This substance forms spontaneously on surfaces of
copper and brass; it differs from the oxide in its
green colour, and in effervescing with dilute sulphuric
acid; with ammonia, however, it demeans itself
in the same manner, and is likewise insoluble in
water. It is poisonous.</p>

<p class='c000'>From the above history of these substances the medical
practitioner will easily perceive under what circumstances,
and by what bodies, metallic vessels of
copper may be rendered dangerous. The oxide and
carbonate, formed in them, will easily dissolve in acidulous
and oily aliments, whence it follows that all
preparations of such food, if conducted in vessels
whose surfaces have contracted this change will be
liable to prove deleterious.<a id='r309' /><a href='#f309' class='c011'><sup>[309]</sup></a> If the vessels be perfectly
clean, acid preparations may be safely boiled
in them, but they must be poured out immediately,
and not suffered to remain sufficiently long to allow
the copper to become oxidized. To the formation of
the oxide of copper, and to the acetic acid contained
in the wine, vinegar, beer, and cider, <i>M. Orfila</i> attributes
the production of the <i>acetate</i> which forms
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>about the corners of the cocks in vessels containing
these liquors. Upon the same principle the <i>soda
water</i> sold in this town, in a draught, from the pump,
is liable to metallic impregnation, as we have fully
satisfied ourselves.</p>

<p class='c000'>Equally important is it for the forensic physician to
be acquainted with the various other sources from
which copper poison may be derived. In consequence
of the fact of the oxide of copper forming, with
the acids, compounds of a beautiful green colour, the
metal is often employed in cookery to impart a vivid
hue to various articles; the sale of pickles, for instance,
frequently depends upon the liveliness of
their green colour; whence we find, in works<a id='r310' /><a href='#f310' class='c011'><sup>[310]</sup></a> on
cookery, directions for ensuring such an effect, by
boiling the pickles with copper coin, or by suffering
them to stand for some time in vessels of that metal.
In the third volume of the <cite>Medical Transactions of
the College of Physicians</cite> we shall find an interesting
history, related by <i>Dr. Percival</i> of Manchester, of a
young lady who amused herself, whilst under the
hands of the hair-dresser, with eating pickled samphire,
of which she consumed two breakfast plates
full; she shortly afterwards complained of great
thirst, pain in the stomach, and a rash appeared
upon her hands and breast. After an illness of nine
days, during which she suffered severe vomitings,
and tormina of the bowels, she expired. Upon examining
the samphire, <i>Dr. Percival</i> found that it was
very strongly impregnated with copper. In the preparation
of confectionary, especially sugar-plums,
and sweatmeats of a green colour, copper is very generally
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>introduced, and many instances are recorded of
their having proved highly deleterious. Catsup is
also said to be occasionally impregnated with verdegris;
and vestiges of this metal have been detected
in the well known cordial, called <i>Shrub</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>In order to prevent the <i>contingent</i> dangers attendant
upon copper vessels, they ought always to be <i>tinned</i>;<a id='r311' /><a href='#f311' class='c011'><sup>[311]</sup></a>
and it is a very curious and interesting fact, that
this latter metal, although it may cover the copper
surface only imperfectly, will nevertheless protect us
from its effects; for <i>M. Proust</i> has shewn that the superior
readiness with which <i>tin</i> is oxidized and acted
upon by acids, when compared with copper, will not
allow this latter metal to appropriate to itself a single
atom of oxygen.</p>

<p class='c000'>But copper vessels, notwithstanding this fact, unless
well tinned, should be dismissed from the service of
the kitchen. The Senate of Sweden, in the year
1753, prohibited them entirely, and ordered that
none but such as were made of iron should be used
in their fleets and army.</p>

<h5 class='c016'><span class='sc'>Verdegris.</span> <i>Ærugo.</i></h5>

<p class='c014'>The verdegris of commerce is a compound mass,
consisting of the acetate, and sub-acetate of copper,
carbonate of copper, and copper partly metallic, and
partly oxidized; it, moreover, contains the stalks of
grapes and other extraneous matter. Boiling water
dissolves it in part, and, at the same time, occasions
in it a chemical change, by transforming one portion
of the <em>sub</em>-acetate into the soluble acetate, and
another, into an oxide of copper, which is precipitated.
With cold water, verdegris demeans itself
very differently; the acetate is dissolved by it, whilst
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>that portion which is in the state of <em>sub</em>-salt remains
suspended in the form of a fine green powder. Vinegar
converts all the <i>ærugo</i> into a soluble acetate.
Sulphuric acid poured on its powder decomposes it
with effervescence, and vapours of acetic acid are
disengaged; a character by which this substance may
be easily identified.</p>

<h5 class='c016'><span class='sc'>Blue Vitriol.</span> <i>Sulphate of Copper.</i><br /><i>Blue Copperas—Roman Vitriol.</i></h5>

<p class='c014'>This salt occurs in crystals of a deep rich blue colour,
and whose form is that of a rhomboidal prism;
their taste is harsh, acrid, and styptic; on exposure
to air they slightly effloresce, and assume a greenish
hue. When treated with sulphuric acid, no effervescence
occurs, a circumstance which at once distinguishes
this salt from <i>ærugo</i>.</p>

<h6 class='c016'><i>Symptoms of Poisoning by the Salts of Copper.</i></h6>

<p class='c014'>The operation of these bodies, upon the human
system, is betrayed by an acrid, styptic, coppery
taste, in the mouth; nausea; head-ache; a dry and
parched tongue; vomiting; coppery eructations; a
cutaneous eruption; violent pains in the bowels;
very frequent alvine evacuations, sometimes green, and
often bloody and blackish; great and painful distention
of the abdomen; small and irregular pulse; heat
of skin; ardent thirst; difficult and laborious respiration;
hiccup; syncope; cold sweats; convulsions—death.
It does not, however, kill so speedily as
arsenic, or corrosive sublimate.</p>

<h6 class='c016'><i>Organic Lesions discovered on Dissection.</i></h6>

<p class='c014'>Where death has been speedily produced by a
cupreous poison, dissection will generally discover
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>inflammation, and even gangrene in the mucous membrane
of the alimentary canal. Like other poisons of
the corrosive class it will also be found to have occasionally
extended its inflammatory action to all the
coats of the canal, producing sloughs, easily detached,
and leaving perforations. <i>Dr. Male</i> has also remarked
that inflammation will sometimes be observed
in the brain; but that this is not an universal effect
of copper poison. It has been stated, that the fluids
contained in the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">primæ viæ</span></i> are, upon these occasions,
very frequently tinged with a green colour.</p>

<h6 class='c016'><i>Chemical Tests by which the presence of the preparations of Copper may be detected.</i></h6>

<p class='c014'>1. <i>The suspected body is in a solid form.</i>—We have
already pointed out the characters by which the principal
preparations of copper may be identified. Our
judgment, however, upon these occasions will require
that confirmation from experiment, which the following
processes are calculated to afford.</p>

<p class='c000'>A. <i>By its reduction to a metallic state.</i> If the
copper presents itself in the form of an oxide, it may
be easily reduced by heating it, in the usual manner,
in contact with some carbonaceous matter; an earthen
crucible will furnish the most convenient vessel for
the occasion. If the substance has been scraped from
a surface of copper, it is probably in the state of carbonate,
(<i>natural verdegris</i>,) and may be calcined with
charcoal in order to procure the metal. Should the
substance in question be true <i>ærugo</i>, we may at once
heat it to redness in an earthen crucible, when, without
the aid of any carbonaceous matter, we shall obtain
metallic copper.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c003'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>B. <i>By the application of certain reagents, or tests, to its solutions.</i></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>It may happen that the quantity of the above substances
is not sufficient to allow their metallic reduction
by calcination. In that case, we must proceed
to obtain a solution; but since neither the oxide,
nor the carbonate, is soluble in water, it will be
necessary to bring them in contact with concentrated
acetic acid, so as to obtain an acetate of copper;
which will furnish the following indications with the
respective tests.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>a.</i> <i>A surface of clean iron.</i> If dipped into the solution
will become coated with metallic copper, and
appear as if transmuted into that metal.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>b.</i> <i>Ammonia.</i> This test, when added in a quantity
more than sufficient to saturate any excess of
acid, will strike a beautiful blue colour; in the first
instance we shall obtain a deep blue precipitate, but
this will be redissolved by an excess of alkali. To
detect the presence of copper, therefore, in pickles,
it is only necessary to cut them into small pieces, and
to pour liquid ammonia, diluted with an equal bulk
of water, over them in a stopped phial: if the pickles
contain the most minute quantity of this metal, the
ammonia will assume a blue colour. In the same
manner cupreous impregnations may be discovered in
the various articles of confectionary above enumerated,
and in those foreign conserves which are imported
into this country, and usually sold in round
boxes.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>c.</i> <i>Sub-carbonate of Potass.</i> By this re-agent a
precipitate of a pale blue colour is produced.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>d.</i> <i>Arsenite of Potass</i> instantly occasions a copious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>precipitate in the acetate of copper, which is of a
green colour, and is in fact an arsenite of the metal.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>e.</i> <i>Triple Prussiate of Potass.</i> This test gives a
brown precipitate with a solution of verdegris,
which is found to consist of prussiate of copper,
and prussiate of iron; while the liquor contains an
acetate of potass.</p>

<h6 class='c016'>2. <i>The suspected poison is mixed and combined with various alimentary substances.</i></h6>

<p class='c014'>We have in this case the same embarrassments to
encounter, as those already noticed under the consideration
of arsenic. Our tests may produce their
respective precipitates, but they will present different
colours according to the nature of the fluids with
which the substance happens to be mixed; whence
the circumstance of colour, so characteristic on other
occasions, cannot be received as a satisfactory indication.
In such a difficulty, we may collect the precipitates,
and calcine them in a crucible with charcoal,
in order to obtain the metal; or we may at once
evaporate the whole of the alimentary mass, and
submit it to a high temperature, by which means all
the vegetable and animal principles, which can form
a part of the liquor vomited, will be decomposed and
converted into several volatile productions, and into
charcoal; this combustible body will decompose the
oxide of copper, and reduce it to its metallic state.<a id='r312' /><a href='#f312' class='c011'><sup>[312]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c000'>Nor is this process without its fallacies; it is often
difficult to recognise the metal, dispersed as it necessarily
must be, in small quantity, through a considerable
mass of charcoal; in this case we are recommended
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>by <i>Orfila</i> to place the product of the calcination
in water, when in a short period, the copper,
from its superior specific gravity will subside from
the lighter particles of charcoal. But it would be
still better to pour nitric acid upon the product of
the calcination, and thereby to obtain a solution of
<i>nitrate of copper</i>, which by filtration might be immediately
prepared for the application of appropriate
re-agents.</p>

<p class='c000'>It merits notice, however, that in certain cases of
poisoning by copper, no vestiges of the substance can
be found in the matters voided from the stomach. In
that case, <i>Orfila</i> directs that the mucous membrane of
the stomach, and of the intestines, should be scraped
off, dried, and submitted to the action of a strong
heat in a crucible. “I have,” says this distinguished
experimentalist, “twice obtained metallic copper,
by calcining in this manner a portion of the membranes
of the stomach of two dogs that I had poisoned
with verdegris. This effect particularly takes place
when the mucous membrane is of a bluish colour,
hard, and strongly adhering to the substance of the
stomach.”</p>

<h4 class='c016'><span class='sc'>Tin</span> and its <span class='sc'>Muriate</span>.</h4>

<p class='c014'>It is clearly established by the experiments of
<i>Bayen</i> and <i>Charlard</i>,<a id='r313' /><a href='#f313' class='c011'><sup>[313]</sup></a> as well as by those of
<i>Proust</i>,<a id='r314' /><a href='#f314' class='c011'><sup>[314]</sup></a> that this metal possesses no poisonous
properties. Its muriate, however, has been shewn
by <i>Orfila</i> to possess highly corrosive properties. It
excites violent vomiting, great depression, and death,
without convulsions. Its antidote is milk, which it
speedily coagulates; and by chemical combination
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>with it, the poison is rendered inert. On dissection,
the stomach is said to have been found corrugated
and indurated, and has been compared to tanned
skin, but its colour is not altered.</p>

<p class='c000'>As this substance is never likely to become an
object of forensic interest, in this kingdom, we shall
pass it over without farther notice.</p>

<h4 class='c016'><span class='sc'>Zinc.</span></h4>

<p class='c014'>The ancients were acquainted with a mineral to
which they gave the name of <i>Cadmia</i>,<a id='r315' /><a href='#f315' class='c011'><sup>[315]</sup></a> from Cadmus,
who first taught the Greeks to use it. They
knew that when melted with copper it formed brass;
and that when burnt, a white spongy kind of ashes
was volatilized, which they used in medicine.<a id='r316' /><a href='#f316' class='c011'><sup>[316]</sup></a>
This mineral contained a good deal of zinc; and yet
there is no proof remaining that the ancients were
acquainted with that metal. It has a brilliant white
colour, with a shade of blue, and is composed of a
number of thin plates adhering together; its specific
gravity is 7·1. When strongly heated in a crucible,
it quickly goes into fusion, absorbs the oxygen of
the atmosphere, and burns with a beautiful white
flame, inclining to green, and extremely brilliant.
The oxide of zinc thus formed, is diffused through the
atmosphere, and is there condensed into extremely
light flakes of a beautiful white appearance. This
oxide was formerly known under the fanciful names
of <i>nihil album; lana philosophorum, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p class='c000'>In its metallic state it is quite inert; but late experiments
by <i>Vauquelin</i> and <i>Deyeux</i>, have proved
that it is very easily acted upon by water, the weakest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>vegetable acids, some saline substances, and butter;
a fact which is hostile to the proposal of employing
this metal for the manufacture of culinary utensils.</p>

<h5 class='c016'><span class='sc'>White Vitriol.</span> <i>Sulphate of Zinc.</i></h5>

<p class='c014'>This salt occurs in masses, consisting of crystals
which are four-sided prisms, terminated by four-sided
pyramids. Their taste is styptic, metallic, and
slightly acidulous. They are soluble in 2·5 times their
weight of water at 60°, and in less than their own
weight of boiling water, but <a id='the'></a>they are quite insoluble in
alcohol. Thus dissolved they redden the tincture of
tournesol.</p>

<h6 class='c016'><i>Symptoms of Poisoning by Sulphate of Zinc.</i></h6>

<p class='c014'>This salt, like tartarized antimony, from the high
degree of emetic virtue which it possesses, generally
proves its own antidote; still, however, it must be
considered as a poison; for several cases are on record,
where the most alarming symptoms, and indeed
death itself, have been the effect of its ingestion.
<i>Metzger</i><a id='r317' /><a href='#f317' class='c011'><sup>[317]</sup></a> mentions the case of a woman, who accidentally
ate a trifling quantity of a cake, into which
<i>White Vitriol</i> had been introduced for the purpose of
shortening the days of an old man. The woman died;
but the intended victim escaped, after severe vomiting.
<i>M. Orfila</i> has also related several cases of poisoning
by this salt. The symptoms which presented
themselves on these occasions were, an astringent
metalline taste, a sense of constriction in the fauces,
so distressing as even to excite in the patient a fear of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>suffocation; frequent vomitings; copious stools;
pains in the epigastric region, extending afterwards
over the whole abdomen; difficulty of breathing;
frequency of pulse; paleness of the countenance, and
coldness of the extremities.</p>

<p class='c000'>We have lately heard of a case in which a noble
lord swallowed a solution of white vitriol, which had
been sent to him by mistake, for Epsom salts, to
which it bears some analogy. Fortunately, however,
the violent emetic effect which followed removed the
poison from the stomach, and obviated any farther
injury.</p>

<h6 class='c016'><i>Organic lesions discovered on Dissection.</i></h6>

<p class='c014'>We have no well authenticated dissection of a
human being who had died from the ingestion of this
poison. The examination of animals<a id='r318' /><a href='#f318' class='c011'><sup>[318]</sup></a> who have
been so killed has shewn nothing more than an inflammation,
not very severe, of the membrane with which
it had come in contact; sometimes dark blood is observed
to be extravasated upon the muscular coat of
the stomach and intestines.</p>

<h6 class='c016'><i>Chemical processes for the detection of Sulphate of Zinc.</i></h6>

<p class='c014'>The chemist must remember that the <i>White Vitriol</i>
of commerce always contains sulphate of iron, and
sometimes sulphate of copper. When dissolved in
distilled water it may be identified by the following
re-agents; <i>viz.</i></p>

<p class='c000'><i>a.</i> <i>Potass</i>, and <i>Ammonia</i>, precipitate an oxide of a
greenish white colour, easily soluble in an excess of
the latter of these alkalies. The oxide obtained by
potass, being washed and dried, and calcined with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>charcoal, is revived, provided the temperature be
very much elevated. It should be known, that if the
salt has been previously purified, the above tests will
occasion a <i>white</i> precipitate.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>b.</i> <i>Prussiate of Potass</i> produces a precipitate of a
rather deep blue colour; which, consists of a mixture
of the prussiates of zinc and iron. If the salt has been
divested of all impurity, the precipitate will be
white.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>c.</i> <i>The Hydro-sulphurets</i> instantly occasion a
blackish precipitate, which, like the former, will be
found to be a mixture of zinc and iron, in the state of
an hydro-sulphuret. If the salt, however, is pure, its
colour will be white with a tinge of yellow.</p>

<h4 class='c016'><span class='sc'>Silver.</span></h4>

<p class='c014'>This metal does not exert any influence on the
living body; but its oxide in combination with nitric
acid constitutes one of the most corrosive of all the
metallic salts.</p>

<h5 class='c016'><span class='sc'>Lunar Caustic.</span> <i>Nitrate of Silver.</i><br /><i>Lapis Infernalis.</i></h5>

<p class='c014'>The usual state in which this substance occurs is
in that of small cylinders, having been cast into
moulds for the purpose of imparting to it a form best
adapted for the purposes it is designed to answer.</p>

<p class='c000'>Its action on animal matter is highly caustic, and
when introduced in any considerable quantity into
the stomach, will induce death by corroding the
texture with which it may come in contact. At the
same time there is reason to believe that the whole,
or part of its composition, may be absorbed; for we
have many instances on record where the frequent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>repetition of this metallic salt, in small doses, has
imparted a blue tinge to the skin, which can only be
explained on the supposition that the oxide of the
metal has been actually deposited in the rete mucosum<a id='r319' /><a href='#f319' class='c011'><sup>[319]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c000'>We are not aware that there is any modern case of
poisoning by this salt<a id='r320' /><a href='#f320' class='c011'><sup>[320]</sup></a>. The medical practitioner,
however, ought to know, that common salt, is its true
antidote; indeed so completely does it decompose
and separate it from water, that if a saturated solution
of nitrate of silver be filtered through common
salt, it may be afterwards drunk with impunity. <i>M.
Orfila</i>, by a series of experiments, has shewn that if
the <i>muriate of soda</i> be administered a very short time
after the ingestion of lunar caustic, it will disarm it
of its virulence by transforming it into an insoluble
muriate, possessing no power of acting on the animal
œconomy.</p>

<h6 class='c016'><i>Chemical processes for the detection of Lunar Caustic.</i></h6>

<p class='c014'>If a small portion of the salt can be procured it
may be dissolved in distilled water, and immediately
identified by the following tests.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>a.</i> <i>Muriatic acid, or any soluble Muriate</i>, will precipitate
the muriate of silver, which is white, curdled,
very heavy, insoluble in water, or nitric acid; but
soluble in liquor ammoniæ; when exposed to the air
it acquires a black colour.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span><i>b.</i> <i>Potass</i>, <i>Soda</i>, and <i>Lime water</i>, will occasion a
precipitate of the oxide, of a deep brown colour.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>c.</i> <i>Ammonia.</i> This alkali will form an <i>ammoniuret
of silver</i>, and in consequence of the solubility of this
new product, little or no disturbance is occasioned by
the test.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>d.</i> <i>Arsenite of Potass.</i> As all re-agents must be
considered as reciprocal in their operation, it is
hardly necessary to state that this is one of the best
tests for nitrate of silver. See the history of its effects
at p. <a href='#Page_240'>240</a>.</p>

<p class='c000'>If it should be necessary to discover the nitrate of
silver amongst the fluids vomited, or those contained
in the stomach of the deceased, we are very properly
directed by <i>M. Orfila</i> to filter, and then assay by the
appropriate tests; if, however, the different aliments
should disguise the characteristic colour and appearance
of these precipitates, we must proceed to desiccate
and calcine them in order to obtain the silver in
a metallic state.</p>

<h4 class='c016'><span class='sc'>The Concentrated Acids.</span></h4>

<p class='c014'>These must be regarded as the most terrible of all
corrosive poisons. Their action is so immediate and
energetic, as generally to destroy the membranes of
the stomach, before their peculiar antidotes can be
applied. Notwithstanding the obvious suffering
they must occasion, and the facility with which they
may be detected, such bodies have frequently, especially
in France, been the instruments of suicide
and murder; whilst in this country, we have had
many lamentable illustrations of their deadly force,
by their ingestion from fatal carelessness. In conformity
with our general plan we shall proceed to
consider the individual substances included under
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>this general class, although the symptoms do not
materially differ in the different kinds, nor are the
indications of cure peculiar to any of them. There
are however chemical characters which exclusively
belong to each acid, with which the forensic physician
must be accurately acquainted, in order that he
may be enabled to detect their presence.</p>

<h5 class='c016'><span class='sc'>Oil of Vitriol.</span> <i>Sulphuric Acid.</i></h5>

<p class='c014'>This acid, when perfectly pure, exists in the form
of a colourless liquid, without smell, and of an oily
consistence; whence its popular name. Its specific
gravity is 1·85, so that, in round numbers, it may be
stated that an ounce, by measure, will weigh fourteen
drachms. It acquires a brown tinge from the smallest
portion of carbonaceous matter; mere exposure to
the atmosphere is sufficient to effect this change, in
consequence of the acid disorganizing and carbonating
the vegetable and animal matter suspended in the
air. This fact sufficiently explains why we generally
find the acid of commerce of a brown colour.</p>

<p class='c000'>Its taste is highly acid and caustic. So powerful
is its affinity for water, that upon its admixture with
this fluid, a heat, sufficiently great to boil water, may
be produced. When exposed in its concentrated
state to the air, it will imbibe at least seven times its
own weight of water, and so rapidly as to have its
weight doubled in a month. Straw, wood, and all
vegetable substances, when immersed in the sulphuric
acid, without heat, are disorganized, softened, and
blackened, and there is separated from them a certain
portion of charcoal. Like the other mineral acids,
the <i>Oil of Vitriol</i> has never been obtained in an
insulated state without water; according to the latest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>views of <i>Sir H. Davy</i>, the composition of the strongest
acid may be expressed as follows. Sulphur 30,
oxygen 45, water 17.</p>

<h6 class='c016'><i>Symptoms of Poisoning by Oil of Vitriol.</i></h6>

<p class='c014'>An extremely austere, acid, and burning taste; a
painful heat in the fauces and throat, along the œsophagus,
and in the stomach; excruciating pain;
nausea, and excessive vomiting; at one time the
fluid vomited is as black as ink, at another reddened
by arterial or venous blood, producing in its passage
through the throat, the most intense pain, accompanied
with a sensation of bitterness quite intolerable;
if, by chance, a portion of it should fall on the
hearth or pavement, or on any other calcareous substance,
it will denote its true nature by an effervescence;
constipation, or sometimes bloody stools;
gripes and excruciating pains over the abdomen, with
a tenderness of these regions, so exquisite as not to
allow the slightest pressure without torment; pains
of the breast; difficulty of breathing; extreme anxiety;
the pulse becomes frequent, small, contracted,
and irregular; shiverings; great restlessness, dejection,
and agitation; convulsive motions of the countenance;
sometimes a cutaneous eruption betrays
itself. Amidst all these symptoms, the intellectual
powers remain unobscured. The parts about the
fauces, the uvula, &amp;c. having lost their vitality,
slough, and become detached, which occasion an indescribable
fetor of the breath, while they produce a
perpetual cough, and the voice becomes so altered,
that it resembles the sounds of a person labouring
under croup.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>
  <h6 class='c016'><i>Organic lesions discovered on Dissection.</i></h6>
</div>

<p class='c014'>As this substance destroys life by simply acting as
an escharotic, it is not difficult to anticipate the disorganization
which dissection will display. The
extent of the lesion, however, must in every case
depend upon the quantity and degree of concentration
of the acid, the state of the stomach in relation
to its alimentary contents, and other incidental circumstances
not to be exactly appreciated. The
mucous membrane of the mouth, the tongue, and
œsophagus, will in general be found destroyed, and
converted into a pulp.</p>

<h6 class='c016'><i>Antidotes.</i></h6>

<p class='c014'>The great indications to be fulfilled in this distressing
case, is the immediate dilution, saturation, and
expulsion of the poison. Copious draughts of water,
holding calcined<a id='r321' /><a href='#f321' class='c011'><sup>[321]</sup></a> magnesia in suspension, should
be administered without any loss of time. If this is
not in readiness, soap and water should be administered;
mucilaginous drinks, milk, and even warm
or cold water, in the absence of more eligible potations,
should not be neglected. It must be never
forgotten, exclaims <i>Orfila</i>, that success upon these
occasions depends upon the activity of the practitioner;
the delay of a few moments will entirely
change the fate of the patient, as the sulphuric acid
destroys the texture of the organs with a fearful
celerity. After having thus neutralized the caustic,
it will be our duty to obviate the effects it may be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>likely to occasion; the lancet must be used with boldness,
and the detraction of blood repeated at short
intervals; at the same time emollient clysters may be
advantageously injected.</p>

<h6 class='c016'><i>Chemical processes for the detection of Oil of Vitriol.</i></h6>

<p class='c014'>In the pure state, there can exist no difficulty in
identifying it; its specific gravity, and its action on
vegetable matter, will, without any other tests, be
quite sufficient to fulfil our object. If heated with
metallic mercury, it will disengage sulphurous acid
gas; and if united with lime, a sulphate of lime will
be produced, which the chemist may easily recognise
by dissolving a portion in distilled water, and assaying
the solution by <i>muriate of baryta</i>, which will produce
with the sulphate a precipitate, insoluble in
nitric acid. By the last mentioned tests we shall be
enabled to detect the presence of sulphuric acid, in
whatever state of complication it may happen to
exist with alimentary matter.</p>

<h5 class='c016'><span class='sc'>Nitric Acid.</span></h5>

<p class='c014'>This acid, when pure, assumes the form of a limpid
fluid, emitting white fumes of a suffocating odour;
its taste is highly acid, and corrosive; and it is at
once distinguished from all other acids, by its tinging
the skin indelibly yellow. When of the specific
gravity 1·5 it contains 74·895 per cent of dry acid,
(whose ultimate elements are one proportional of nitrogen,
and five of oxygen) the complement 25·105
parts, is water.<a id='r322' /><a href='#f322' class='c011'><sup>[322]</sup></a> It is decomposed with violent
action by all combustibles, and when mixed with volatile
oils it causes their inflammation.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>From the facility with which this acid undergoes
decomposition, it is rarely found in commerce in a
colourless condition; indeed the action of light is
sufficient to impart a tawny tinge to it; when this
change has proceeded to such an extent as to render
the acid orange coloured, it is called <i>Nitrous acid</i>,
or, in the language of the arts, <i>aqua fortis</i>, although
in a chemical point of view, such a nomenclature
is incorrect, for it is nothing more than nitric
acid, holding nitrous acid gas loosely combined.</p>

<h6 class='c016'><i>Symptoms of Poisoning by Nitric Acid.</i></h6>

<p class='c014'>This acid has been so frequently swallowed in France,
for the purpose of committing suicide, that it has
enabled the pathologists of that country to afford a
very satisfactory account of its operation, and effects.
To <i>M. Tartra</i> we are particularly indebted for a very
full and interesting investigation of the subject, and
we shall avail ourselves upon the present occasion, of
the many facts and observations with which his treatise<a id='r323' /><a href='#f323' class='c011'><sup>[323]</sup></a>
abounds. In describing the symptoms occasioned
by the ingestion of this acid, <i>M. Tartra</i> establishes
four different gradations, viz. 1. When the
death is speedy, for it is never sudden, it commonly
takes place from the <i>primary</i> effects in about twenty-four
hours, varying from six to forty-eight hours.
2. When it proves fatal from its <i>secondary</i> effects, at
different intervals, from fifteen days to several years.
3. When death does not take place, but the recovery
is imperfect. 4. When a perfect cure is sooner or
later obtained. The first case is illustrated by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>following example, which will serve to convey a very
just idea of the progress and intensity of the symptoms.
“A man, driven by distress to commit suicide,
under the greatest agitation of mind, and upon
an empty stomach, swallowed, at a draught, two ounces
of concentrated nitric acid. Instantly he was seized
with the most excruciating pains and agitation, and
could not lie in bed, but rolled himself upon the
floor. Vomiting came on, accompanied by a general
sensation of coldness, especially in the extremities.
Every time he vomited, the matter effervesced upon
the pavement. A solution of soap and oil was administered
to him, and in two hours he was brought to
the hospital, often having vomited, and stopped on
the road to drink. On his arrival, he had emollient
drinks, especially linseed tea, in great abundance.
He was in continual agitation, and his countenance
was greatly altered. He now vomited every instant
a blackish glairy matter; he opened his mouth easily,
and his tongue was white, with a tinge of yellow; he
complained of acute pains in his mouth, along the
œsophagus, and in his stomach. His belly, slightly
tense, could not bear the slightest pressure, without
great torment. The surface of the body was cold;
the pulse small and frequent; he had hiccup, and
the respiration was laborious.</p>

<p class='c000'>His symptoms increased. He uttered sighs and
lamentations; his limbs became icy; a cold sweat
covered his whole body; his pulse was scarcely
perceptible; the pain was constant; still he could
rise and make continual but useless efforts to quench
his thirst, and satisfy his urgent desire to void urine,
and go to stool. He continued in this state during
the night; the matters vomited became more clear,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>and of a yellow colour. He at last made a few drops
of urine. The shocking appearance of his body
already resembled that of a corpse, but he retained
his senses, and was speaking when he expired, nineteen
hours after swallowing the acid.” The burning
heat and pains which are commonly the immediate
effects of the ingestion of this acid are very variable
in their intensity and duration, and <i>M. Tartra</i> observes
that, in general, they are not in proportion to
the quantity or strength of the acid swallowed. It
often happens that persons who have taken only a
small dose, are seized with the most excruciating
and dreadful pains, and some of those who have
swallowed a great quantity, two or three ounces for
example, have had scarcely any suffering, but remained
very tranquil. In the first case, the patients
either recover, or survive a long time; in the second,
speedy death is almost always the consequence; thus
a young man of twenty died in twenty hours, without
any agitation or signs of acute pains. On opening
the body, the highest degree of disorganization appeared,
perforations of the stomach, and great effusion
of its contents into the abdomen. The second
variety of the progress and termination of poisoning
by nitric acid, exhibits, at first, the same phenomena
as the preceding; but less alarming symptoms succeed
by degrees; after some months, the inner membrane
of the alimentary canal detaches itself in portions,
the patient falls into a marasmus, and dies.
We are here presented with a case of <i>consecutive</i> poisoning,
see <i>page</i> <a href='#Page_147'>147</a>.</p>

<p class='c000'>The third termination is in imperfect recovery. A
slow and progressive amendment ensures the safety
of the patient; but there still remains some complaint;
obscure pains in the throat, and especially in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>the epigastric region; habitual constipation, occasional
vomiting, and increased sensibility of the
stomach, so that it can only support light nourishment
and bland liquors; in short, they continue invalids
during the rest of their lives; they are subject
to repeated and even habitual indispositions, and
sometimes to pain and insupportable heat of the stomach;
but they are able to follow their occupations,
and long survive their poisoning.</p>

<p class='c000'>The total disappearance of the symptoms produced
by swallowing nitric acid; or complete and absolute
recovery without leaving any consequences, is the
last variety of termination.</p>

<h6 class='c016'><i>Organic lesions discovered on Dissection.</i></h6>

<p class='c014'><i>Tartra</i> has furnished us with the following interesting
account of the dissection of those who have
died of the primary effects of nitric acid. The external
appearance of the body presents no alteration;
every part is sound and natural, and possesses, in a
certain degree, the firmness and freshness of life.
The epidermis of the margins of the lips has commonly
an orange colour, more or less deep. It seems
burnt and easily separates. Sometimes yellow spots
are discovered on the hands and other parts of the
body, caused by the contact of the acid. A yellow
fluid, in some cases very abundant, flows from the
mouth and nostrils, and the belly is considerably distended
with air. The alimentary canal is remarkably
affected. All the internal membrane of the mouth is
burnt, and has sometimes a white colour, but is more
commonly yellow; it is separate in some places, and
adheres in others. The teeth are often loose, and
have a very marked yellow colour at their <em>crown</em>.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>The mucous membrane of the pharynx exhibits the
same change, or is in a state of inflammation of a
dirty red colour. The whole extent of the œsophagus
is lined with a dense mass of a fine yellow colour, dry
on its surface, unctuous and greasy to the touch, and
which seems to be formed both of the mucous membrane,
altered in a particular manner, and of the
albumen contained in the viscid fluid which exudes
from the membrane of the œsophagus, solidified by
the nitric acid. This lining adheres in very few points,
and is easily detected from the other membranes of
the œsophagus, which are brown and blood-shot.
When the stomach is not perforated, it has commonly
a considerable size; externally, its membranes are
slightly and partially inflamed, but very much towards
the pylorus and beginning of the duodenum.
Its colour is faded, livid, of a yellowish green, with
large gangrenous spots. It adheres every where to
the neighbouring parts, the diaphragm, liver, spleen,
and transverse arch of the colon, by means of a concrete
lymphatic exudation; its sides, which are thin
and yellow in some places, and thick and black in
others, exhibit net-work of dilated blood-vessels
filled with black coagulated blood. Often there are
several points of the stomach dissolved, and ready to
burst with the slightest touch; it contains a great
quantity of gas, which has a peculiar smell, resembling
that of bitter almonds; it also very commonly
contains a great quantity of yellow matter, of a
pultaceous consistence; the substance of the stomach
is generally swelled in some places, and deeply
marked with black, without being dissolved; this
effect is most remarkable at the great end, into which
the acid seems to fall by its weight; the rugæ of the
stomach are very brown, and are reduced to a mucilaginous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>consistence. The other parts of the alimentary
canal exhibit the same organic lesions, although
the phenomena have less intensity in proportion as
the part is more distant from the stomach.</p>

<p class='c000'>In those cases where the stomach is found perforated,
its bulk is very small; the holes commonly
occur in the large and small extremities; their form
is circular, and their edges thin, and as if dissolved.
The urinary bladder contains no urine, although the
patient have not discharged any.</p>

<p class='c000'>The appearances upon dissection of those who die
of the <i>secondary</i> effects are entirely different from
those above described. It would be difficult to find
an example of greater emaciation, more advanced
consumption, or more disgusting form. Nothing is
equal to the degree of withering, and decrepitude of
the whole organs; their colour is faded; the internal
cavities do not contain the usual serum; the cellular
and muscular systems are almost annihilated; the
bones become dry, as in persons of advanced age,
and break with extraordinary facility; but these
changes are general and secondary, and depend upon
local organic derangement of the alimentary tube.
The stomach and whole intestinal canal are contracted
to an extremely small size; the intestines are not
larger than the little finger, sometimes not exceeding
a thick writing quill; their coats are very thick, their
cavity almost obliterated, and containing only a little
mucosity. The stomach, which often resembles a
portion of a small intestine, appears sound externally,
and only presents some adhesions to the neighbouring
viscera; internally, the most remarkable change is
the contraction of the pylorus, the passage through
which will scarcely admit a probe; and the membranes
of the stomach itself are so thickened and compacted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>around it, that they have lost all their natural
suppleness. On the internal surface, there are irregular
spots, or rather smooth and red places, which
seem to be covered with a regenerated mucous membrane,
less villous than that which had been destroyed
by the action of the acid; these cicatrices are
particularly large and numerous in the great end of
the stomach, and around the circumference of the
pylorus.</p>

<h6 class='c016'><i>Chemical processes by which the presence of Nitric Acid may be discovered.</i></h6>

<p class='c014'>If the acid be in any quantity, and without mixture,
there cannot exist any difficulty in demonstrating
its presence. If added to copper filings, there
will be a copious disengagement of orange-coloured
fumes, and a nitrate of copper of a blue colour will
remain, as the product. If it be saturated with potass,
we shall at once obtain by due evaporation the
well known substance, nitre; this salt will announce
its nature by deflagrating with charcoal or sulphur.
This latter test is the one we must employ for the detection
of nitric acid, when mixed with vinegar, and
other liquids. Where the acid has combined with
the animal matters with which it may have come into
contact, they must be boiled for an hour in a solution
of pure potass, when the solution will assume a reddish
appearance; this must be filtered, and evaporated
in a capsule of porcelain, when the mass so
obtained will leave a residuum of nitrate of potass.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Dr. Marcet</i>, in a paper just published in the <cite>Philosophical
Transactions</cite>,<a id='r324' /><a href='#f324' class='c011'><sup>[324]</sup></a> on the composition of sea
<span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>water, employed a new mode of assaying the solution
for nitric acid, and for which he acknowledges himself
indebted to <i>Dr. Wollaston</i>. Having concentrated
the <i>bittern</i> in a glass vessel, until it began to
deposit solid matter, he added sulphuric acid and
gold leaf, and boiled the mixture; the gold leaf was
not in the least acted upon, nor was any smell of nitric
acid perceived; but on adding the smallest quantity
of nitre to the same mixture, the gold was dissolved,
and the smell of <i>aqua regia</i> instantly perceived. The
rationale of the experiment is obvious, gold, although
insoluble in muriatic acid, is instantly dissolved on
the addition of nitric acid, in consequence of the developement
of chlorine.</p>

<h5 class='c016'><span class='sc'>Spirit of Salt.</span> <i>Muriatic Acid.</i></h5>

<p class='c014'>The liquid acid, of which we are about to treat, is
a solution of muriatic acid gas in water; when of the
specific gravity 1·16, according to <i>Davy</i>, it contains
32·32 per cent. of the gas, which recent experiments
have proved to be a compound of <i>Chlorine</i> (oxy-muriatic
acid) and <i>hydrogen</i>, in equal volumes. It has
accordingly received a name expressive of its composition,
and is called <i>Hydro-chloric acid</i>. Its odour is
strong and peculiar; when exposed to the air it emits
white fumes; its taste is intensely sour and caustic;
it is, however, the weakest of the three mineral acids,
and no remarkable elevation of temperature is produced
by dilution. It readily combines with potass,
soda, &amp;c. and furnishes a class of salts which may
be easily recognised by their characters.</p>

<h6 class='c016'><i>Symptoms of Poisoning by Muriatic Acid.</i></h6>

<p class='c014'>As the effects of muriatic acid do not differ from
those which have been described, as the consequences
<span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>of poisoning by the other mineral acids, it will be unnecessary
to enumerate them. <i>Orfila</i>, however, remarks,
that the patients who have swallowed a certain
quantity of it, emit, in the first moments of the accident,
a thick smoke of a white colour, and very pungent
smell.</p>

<h6 class='c016'><i>Chemical processes for the detection of Muriatic Acid.</i></h6>

<p class='c014'>This acid, in its free state, immediately announces
its nature by the fumes which it emits. When the
acid, however, exists in a more questionable shape,
as in the matter vomited by the patient, or in that
found in the digestive canal after death, it will be
necessary to saturate the liquid part with pure potass,
and to boil it for some time, when we shall obtain a
fluid, from which the nitrate of silver will throw down
a dense precipitate. By evaporation, we shall obtain
a crystallized muriate, which may be identified by the
following tests: 1, When concentrated sulphuric
acid is poured upon it, a brisk effervescence is immediately
occasioned, and the muriatic acid is disengaged
in the form of white vapours, which are thick,
and of an excessively pungent smell. 2, If instead
of employing concentrated sulphuric acid, this acid
be used in a state of dilution, and the muriate be
mixed with some substance which easily yields its
oxygen, the muriatic acid will be decomposed, its
hydrogen, combining with the oxygen so as to form
water, while the chlorine will be disengaged, and by
its pungent and peculiar odour at once announce the
nature of the acid under examination.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>
  <h5 class='c016'><span class='sc'>Oxalic Acid.</span> <i>Acid of Sugar.</i><a id='r325' /><a href='#f325' class='c011'><sup>[325]</sup></a></h5>
</div>

<p class='c014'>This salt occurs in small crystals, whose form is
that of a four sided prism. It is extremely acid to
the taste, so that by applying the tongue to one of
its crystals, its nature may be immediately discovered.
It dissolves in twice its weight of cold, and in an
equal weight of hot water; it is also soluble in
boiling alcohol which takes up about half its weight;
the solutions act powerfully on the vegetable
colours, and at once denote their acid properties.
On account of the strong resemblance which the crystals
of this acid bear to those of sulphate of magnesia,
or <i>Epsom</i> salts, many fatal accidents have occurred.
We are not aware that it is ever purchased, in retail,
for any other purpose than as a detergent, to clean
the tops of boots; in the large way, it is an article of
extensive trade with the calico printers. Its salts<a id='r326' /><a href='#f326' class='c011'><sup>[326]</sup></a>
are likewise employed for various purposes in the arts.</p>

<p class='c000'>Amongst the many schemes which have been proposed
to secure the public against the possibility of
mistaking this acid for Epsom salts, there does not
appear to be one which admits of successful application;
nor are we able to propose any test of discrimination
which is not far inferior in accuracy and convenience,
to that which is afforded by the mere taste
of the crystal; indeed we cannot understand how so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>acid a solution can be swallowed, without an immediate
discovery.</p>

<h6 class='c016'><i>Symptoms of Poisoning by Oxalic Acid.</i></h6>

<p class='c014'>From the history of the many cases on record, it
appears that this acid produces all the grievous
symptoms, which characterise the action of a corrosive
poison; its operation upon the stomach is similar
to that of any other powerful acid; and dissection
displays the same destruction of parts, as that we
have already described under the consideration of
the mineral acids.</p>

<h6 class='c016'><i>Antidotes.</i></h6>

<p class='c014'>We should endeavour to form as quickly as possible
an insoluble oxalate of lime; copious draughts
of lime water, or magnesia and water, should be
administered; and vomiting immediately excited.</p>

<h6 class='c016'><i>Chemical tests for the detection of Oxalic Acid.</i></h6>

<p class='c014'>If any of its crystals can be obtained, we shall be
immediately able to identify them. They dissolve
very readily in water, and since the oxalic has a
greater affinity for lime, than any other acid, and
forms an insoluble salt with it, we have thus a ready
test of its presence, for it will decompose all the calcareous
salts, not even excepting the sulphate.</p>

<h4 class='c016'><span class='sc'>Boiling Water.</span></h4>

<p class='c014'>Many cases are recorded of the death of children
from the ingestion of boiling water; an accident
which will be always liable to occur, as long as the
peasant allows his family to quench their thirst by
drinking the cold water through the spout of the tea
kettle. It has been very generally supposed that fatal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>effects have, on these occasions, supervened the high
state of inflammation produced in the æsophagus and
stomach by the boiling liquid. <i>Dr. Marshall Hall</i>
has, however, lately published a very interesting paper
on this subject, in the twelfth volume of the <cite>Medico-Chirurgical
Transactions</cite>; from which it would
appear, that the patient, under these circumstances,
actually dies of suffocation as in croup; and that the
boiling water is arrested in its progress to the stomach
by the convulsive action of the muscles of the pharynx.
In passing, however, to the posterior part of the
mouth, it scalds the <i>epiglottis</i>, and <i>glottis</i>, which afterwards
become more and more swollen, until at length
the <i>rima glottidis</i>, or orifice into the larynx, becomes
completely obstructed. Here then we have a new instance
in which the operation of laryngotomy, or of
tracheotomy, may be performed with the effect of
preventing impending suffocation, and perhaps of saving
life. <i>Dr. Marshall Hall</i> relates four cases in
illustration of this interesting fact; of which one recovered
from imminent suffocation immediately after
screaming<a id='r327' /><a href='#f327' class='c011'><sup>[327]</sup></a>; two died from suffocation, one 10, the
other 17 hours, after the accident; the fourth was
completely relieved by the operation of tracheotomy,
and survived 34 hours, but died, exhausted by the
irritation produced by the primary affection.</p>

<h4 class='c016'><span class='sc'>Melted Lead.</span></h4>

<p class='c014'>An instance stands recorded in the history of the
destruction of the Eddystone-light house, by fire,
where a quantity of melted lead fell into the mouth,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>and was swallowed by a person who was attentively
watching the conflagration. It is very singular, that
this man lived many days after the accident; a fact
which at least shews what extensive injury the stomach
will occasionally sustain, without the immediate
destruction of life. The lead taken out of the stomach
after death, in this case, weighed exactly seven
ounces, five drachms, and eighteen grains.<a id='r328' /><a href='#f328' class='c011'><sup>[328]</sup></a></p>

<h4 class='c016'><span class='sc'>The Caustic Alkalies.</span></h4>

<p class='c014'>These bodies are distinguished by a highly corrosive
and peculiar taste; they change the blue<a id='r329' /><a href='#f329' class='c011'><sup>[329]</sup></a> juices
of vegetables to a green, and the yellow to a brown;
they are soluble in water, and have the power of
imparting the same property to oils, by combining
with them, and thus forming saponaceous compounds.
With the different acids they constitute peculiar salts.
When applied to the flesh of animals they act as powerful
caustics, destroying its texture, and ultimately
dissolving it; they are accordingly arranged with
great propriety under the head of corrosive poisons.</p>

<p class='c000'>There are three<a id='r330' /><a href='#f330' class='c011'><sup>[330]</sup></a> alkalies—<i>potass</i>, <i>soda</i>, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span><i>ammonia</i>. To the two former the epithet <i>fixed</i> has
been applied, since they require a very high temperature
for their sublimation; while to the third,
that of <i>volatile</i> has been assigned, because, when uncombined,
it exists in a state of gas. <i>Potass</i>, as it
was considered the product of vegetation, has received
the name of the <i>vegetable</i> alkali, while <i>soda</i>, as the
base of rock salt, has been distinguished by that of
<i>mineral</i> alkali. The distinctions, however, originally
established by <i>Avicenna</i>, must now be abandoned,
for they have not the slightest foundation in
truth; <i>potass</i>, so far from being the exclusive product
of vegetation, exists as a constituent part of the
<i>Granite</i>, which forms the foundation of our globe; it
has also been discovered in the <i>Pumice stone</i>; in some
minerals of the <i>Zeolite</i> family; in the <i>Leucite</i>; in the
aluminous ores of <i>La Tolfa</i>, &amp;c. and, although potass
is undoubtedly procured by lixiviation from the ashes
of burnt wood, and other vegetable substances, yet
there is ample grounds for supposing that the living
plant receives it from the soil in which it vegetates.</p>

<h5 class='c016'><span class='sc'>Potass</span>, or <i>Potash</i>—</h5>

<p class='c017'><span class='sc'>Liquor Potassæ</span>—<span class='sc'>Potassa Fusa</span>, or <i>Kali Causticum</i>—<i>Lapis
Infernalis</i>—<i>Causticum commune acerrimum</i>.
<span class='sc'>Potassa cum Calce</span>—<span class='sc'>Potassæ Sub-carbonas</span>,
or <i>Salt of Tartar</i>—<i>Potash</i>—<i>Pearl ash</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>Potass is rarely met with in a pure form, except in
the laboratory of the philosophical chemist, and is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>therefore not likely to become an object of judicial
enquiry; but in various states of mixture, as presented
in the different preparations above enumerated,
it may become the accidental, as well as criminal
means of poisoning; we shall therefore consider
the chemical history of these different preparations
separately, and then describe the symptoms
which they generally occasion.</p>

<h6 class='c016'><i>Liquor Potassæ.</i></h6>

<p class='c014'>This may be considered as a nearly pure solution
of potass, although, as it is usually prepared,
it contains small portions of <i>muriate</i> and <i>sulphate
of potass</i>, <i>silica</i>, and <i>lime</i>. It is a limpid, dense,
colourless solution; when rubbed between the fingers
it feels soapy, in consequence of a partial solution
of the cuticle. As it constitutes a medicine in common
use, and, moreover, forms the basis of many
<i>quack medicines</i>, as well as of those preparations
which are sold under the name of <i>Depilatories</i>, it may
readily become the accidental instrument of mischief.</p>

<h6 class='c016'><i>Chemical Tests for its detection.</i></h6>

<p class='c014'>There cannot exist any difficulty in this investigation;
its highly alkaline characters will be immediately
announced by its effects on the vegetable test
papers, and by its power of saturating acids; while
the particular species of alkali may be readily identified
by the following reagents.</p>

<p class='c000'>(<i>a</i>) <i>Carbonic acid; or water saturated with the gas.</i>
This will not produce any<a id='r331' /><a href='#f331' class='c011'><sup>[331]</sup></a> disturbance in the solution
<span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>of potass; a fact which at once serves to distinguish
this alkali from the earths, <i>baryta</i> and <i>lime</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>(<i>b</i>) <i>Deuto-muriate of Platina</i> occasions a canary-yellow
precipitate, consisting of the deutoxide of
platina, potass, and muriatic acid; as this precipitate
is, to a certain extent, soluble in water, the test
may fail through dilution. With soda, this reagent
will not occasion any precipitate, a fact which depends
upon the solubility of the triple salt formed,
and affords an easy method of distinguishing the fixed
alkalies from each other.</p>

<p class='c000'>(<i>c</i>) <i>Tartaric acid.</i> If an excess of this acid be
added, we shall obtain crystals of a <i>bi-tartrate</i>; a
phenomenon which will not take place if soda be the
alkali employed.</p>

<h6 class='c016'><i>Potassa Fusa</i>, or <i>Kali Causticum</i>.</h6>

<p class='c014'>This substance, which occurs in sticks, or cylinders,
is an extremely caustic and deliquescent substance;
it is principally employed in surgery, to
establish an ulcer; or, instead of incision, to open a
tumour. See <cite>Pharmacologia</cite>. As it differs from potass,
only in the degree of purity, it is unnecessary
to offer any farther remarks.</p>

<h6 class='c016'><i>Potassa cum Calce.</i></h6>

<p class='c014'>This is a mixture of the preceding substance with
lime, which is added with a view to diminish the deliquescent
property of the alkali, and thus to render
it more manageable as an escharotic. There will be
no difficulty in separating these ingredients. Their
different solubilities will furnish an easy mode of
effecting it to a certain extent, and we may then precipitate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>the remaining portion of lime, by carbonic
acid.</p>

<h6 class='c016'><i>Sub-carbonate of Potass</i>—<i>Salt of Tartar</i>—<i>Pearl-ash</i>—<i>Potash</i>.</h6>

<p class='c014'>Although potass becomes comparatively mild, by
its union with carbonic acid; yet the present preparation
retains so much causticity as to render it poisonous,
if administered in any considerable dose.
<i>Plenck</i> reports a case of this kind, where a patient
having swallowed an ounce of <i>salt of tartar</i>, was
shortly afterwards seized with a violent vomiting,
which continued for forty-eight hours, followed by a
violent inflammation of the stomach; from which,
however, he ultimately recovered.</p>

<h6 class='c016'><i>Symptoms of Poisoning by any of the above preparations of Potass.</i></h6>

<p class='c014'>A styptic, urinous, and caustic taste; a severe heat
in the throat; violent vomiting, generally of alkaline
matter, turning the syrups of violets green, and where
the alkali has been in the state of <i>carbonate</i>, effervescing
with acids; sometimes the matter thus ejected is
mixed with blood; copious alvine evacuations; severe
pain in the epigastric region; excruciating tormina
of the bowels; depravation of the intellectual
faculties, and death. It will be easily perceived that
the above symptoms merely indicate the operation of
a corrosive poison. They offer no characteristic peculiarities
which can enable us to decide upon the
particular substance that has been swallowed, unless,
indeed, the matter vomited can be submitted to examination.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span>
  <h6 class='c016'><i>Antidotes.</i></h6>
</div>

<p class='c014'>From the experiments of <i>Orfila</i>, it appears that
vinegar, diluted with water, is the remedy which can
be administered with the greatest success, where any
preparation of this alkali has been swallowed in a
poisonous dose.</p>

<h6 class='c016'><i>Organic lesions discovered on dissection.</i></h6>

<p class='c014'>In consequence of the peculiar action of this alkali
upon animal matter, we shall generally find the stomach
perforated, and its coats extensively dissolved.
We shall moreover discover the usual indications of
violent inflammation in this viscus, as well as in the
intestines.</p>

<h5 class='c016'><span class='sc'>Soda.</span></h5>

<p class='c014'>We have already stated by what chemical reagents
this alkali may be distinguished from <i>potass</i>; it only remains
for us to observe that its physiological action, the
symptoms arising from its ingestion, and the organic
lesions discovered on dissection, are strictly analogous
to those we have described as the effects of potass.</p>

<h6 class='c016'><span class='sc'>Ammonia</span>, and its <span class='sc'>Carbonate</span>.</h6>

<p class='c014'>Ammonia, in its uncombined state, exists in the
state of gas, and is incapable of application; its affinity,
however, for water, enables it to combine with
that fluid, and to form liquid ammonia, (<i>Liquor Ammoniæ</i>)
in which state it is useful in medicine, and in the
arts. This solution is colourless; its taste extremely
caustic; and its odour strong, pungent, and peculiar.
Exposed to the action of heat, the ammoniacal gas
<span class='pageno' id='Page_324'>324</span>is driven off, and may be recognised by its characteristic
odour, as well as by its effects upon moistened
<i>turmeric</i> paper. When brought into contact with
muriatic acid, it will form dense white vapours, consisting
of <i>muriate of ammonia</i>. A most elegant and
sensible test for ammoniacal gas is afforded by a
mixed solution, consisting of arsenious acid and nitrate
of silver; these substances when mixed in solution
do not occasion the least disturbance in each
other, for reasons already explained, (see page <a href='#Page_240'>240</a>)
but upon spreading a portion of the liquid upon glass
or paper, and bringing ammoniacal gas into contact,
a beautiful yellow cloud immediately diffuses itself
over the surface of the solution.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Sub-carbonate of ammonia</i> occurs in solid, white,
semi-transparent masses, of a highly pungent and ammoniacal
odour. Its chemical composition has been
found to vary materially according to the circumstances
under which it has been prepared; <i>Mr. R.
Phillips</i>, who has made some highly interesting experiments
upon this subject, considers the <i>sub-carbonate</i>
to be a <i>sesqui</i>-carbonate, composed of 3 atoms
of carbonic acid, 2 atoms of ammonia, and 2 of water.
By long exposure to the air, its pungency is lost, and
it is converted into an inodorous carbonate.</p>

<h6 class='c016'><i>Symptoms of poisoning by Ammonia.</i></h6>

<p class='c014'>Cases wherein death has been produced in a few
minutes, from the ingestion of liquid ammonia, stand
recorded on the authority of <i>Martinet</i>, <i>Huxham</i>, <i>Haller</i>,
and other physiologists. In such cases the lips,
tongue, and fauces are described as being burnt by
the causticity of the fluid; while hemorrhage of the
intestines marks the organic lesions which it occasions.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>The nervous system would appear also to
suffer greatly, at the same time that the abdominal
organs are affected with violent inflammation.</p>

<h4 class='c016'><span class='sc'>The Caustic Alkaline Earths.</span></h4>

<p class='c014'>Under this division, we have to consider the two
earths, <i>Lime</i> and <i>Baryta</i>; both of which are highly
corrosive, although they essentially differ from each
other in their physiological action. In this respect
they may be compared to <i>corrosive sublimate</i> and
<i>arsenic</i>, and offer an additional illustration of the imperfection
of the present classification; for while
<i>lime</i> acts as a local caustic upon the parts with which
it comes in contact, <i>baryta</i> will require, for its action,
to be absorbed and carried into the current of the
circulation.</p>

<h5 class='c016'><span class='sc'>Quick Lime.</span></h5>

<p class='c014'>This earth is of a white colour, and of a hot caustic
taste; with acids it forms peculiar salts; a fact which
we shall shew affords the most decisive means of identifying
its presence. It changes vegetable blues to a
green, and reddens <i>turmeric</i>; it is capable of fusion;
so great is its affinity for water, that it will absorb
and solidify one third of its weight of that fluid, and
yet remain perfectly dry. The heat, therefore, that
is evolved in the process of slacking lime, evidently
proceeds from the water, which yields its caloric, as
it passes from the liquid to the solid state.</p>

<h6 class='c016'><i>Symptoms of poisoning by Lime.</i></h6>

<p class='c014'>It is perhaps the least energetic of the corrosive
poisons; and yet, when taken in any quantity, it will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_326'>326</span>produce nausea, vomiting, colics, frequent stools,
and all the symptoms which characterise, or are complicated
with, inflammation of the stomach and intestines.<a id='r332' /><a href='#f332' class='c011'><sup>[332]</sup></a>
Lime in combination with carbonic acid
is not considered as poisonous.</p>

<h6 class='c016'><i>Organic lesions discovered on dissection.</i></h6>

<p class='c014'>In examining the body of an animal that has been
killed by caustic lime, we shall find the mucous membrane
of the stomach reddened, and evincing marks
of inflammation in those parts which have been in
contact with it.</p>

<h6 class='c016'><i>Tests for the detection of Quick-lime.</i></h6>

<p class='c014'>We may proceed, if the substance be free from
mixture, to obtain a solution of the earth in distilled
water, and to assay it by the following reagents.</p>

<p class='c000'>(<i>a</i>) <i>Carbonic acid, and the soluble alkaline sub-carbonates</i>
produce a copious white precipitate, which is
soluble in an excess of carbonic acid. The <i>carbonate
of lime</i>, of which this precipitate consists, is also decomposed
by muriatic acid, with effervescence, a
soluble muriate remaining.</p>

<p class='c000'>(<i>b</i>) <i>Oxalic acid, and oxalate of ammonia.</i> They
precipitate lime-water of a white colour, and the resulting
<i>oxalate</i> is not soluble in an excess of acid.</p>

<p class='c000'>(<i>c</i>) <i>Sulphuric acid.</i> This acid does not precipitate
lime water, since the <i>sulphate of lime</i> formed does not
require more than 300 parts of water to dissolve it.
Whereas, says <i>M. Orfila</i>, the smallest quantity of an
exceedingly diluted solution of <i>baryta</i> becomes instantly
turbid on the addition of that acid, because
<span class='pageno' id='Page_327'>327</span>the <i>sulphate of baryta</i> is insoluble in several thousand
times its weight of water. By this test, therefore, we
are at once enabled to distinguish lime-water, from
barytic water.</p>

<h5 class='c016'><span class='sc'>Baryta, and its Salts.</span></h5>

<p class='c014'><i>Baryta</i>, like lime, is a solid, heavy, alkaline earth,
having an acrid and peculiar taste; and turning the
syrup of violets <i>green</i>, and the juice of turmeric <i>red</i>.
When perfectly calcined, it absorbs water very rapidly,
disengaging at the same time a quantity of
caloric; the phenomenon is similar to that of <i>slacking
lime</i>, and admits of the same explanation. It dissolves
in about 20 parts of water, at the temperature of 60°;
but boiling water will dissolve half its weight of this
earth, part of which will crystallize on cooling.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Muriate of Baryta.</span> This salt crystallises in
square plates, or four-sided prisms; its taste is acrid
and pungent. It dissolves in 2½ parts of distilled
water at 60° <i>Fah.</i> The solution is limpid and colourless,
and has been employed in medicine, as a remedy
in scrofula, cancer, some forms of syphilis, and in
hectic fever connected with ulceration. <i>Dr. Johnstone</i>
says that he has seen a delicate female take as
much as thirty drops of a saturated solution of this
salt, <em>repeatedly</em>, without nausea; whence he concludes
that it would require at least 2 or 3 drachms
to do mischief.<a id='r333' /><a href='#f333' class='c011'><sup>[333]</sup></a></p>

<h6 class='c016'><i>Symptoms of poisoning by Baryta.</i></h6>

<p class='c014'>All the soluble compounds of this earth are poisonous,
especially the <i>muriate</i>; which, whether injected
<span class='pageno' id='Page_328'>328</span>into the veins, introduced into the stomach, or externally
applied to an abraded surface, will occasion
death in a very short period. We are not aware
that any case stands recorded of poisoning by baryta.
<i>Orfila</i><a id='r334' /><a href='#f334' class='c011'><sup>[334]</sup></a> and <i>Brodie</i><a id='r335' /><a href='#f335' class='c011'><sup>[335]</sup></a> have, however, investigated
the symptoms which this poison produces on animals,
and they appear to be analogous to those occasioned
by the ingestion of arsenic. The muriate, on account
of its greater solubility, would appear to be much
more active than the pure earth, or its carbonate.</p>

<h6 class='c016'><i>Physiological action of Baryta.</i></h6>

<p class='c014'>Barytic poisons require to be absorbed before they
act on the system; they may therefore destroy by external
application, although it would appear that,
unlike arsenic, they act sooner when internally administered.
<i>Mr. Brodie</i> thinks that the <i>muriate of
baryta</i> occasions death by acting upon the brain and
the heart; at the same time it exerts a local action,
and corrodes the viscus with which it comes into
contact.</p>

<h6 class='c016'><i>Antidotes.</i></h6>

<p class='c014'>It has been shewn by the experiments of <i>Orfila</i>,
that the soluble sulphates, as <i>Glauber</i> or <i>Epsom salts</i>,
by converting the <i>baryta</i> into an insoluble <i>sulphate</i>,
will act as antidotes to its virulence. In the first instance,
therefore, it will be prudent to produce this
chemical decomposition in the poison, and then to
expel it, as quickly as possible, by emetics.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_329'>329</span>
  <h6 class='c016'><i>Chemical tests for the detection of Baryta.</i></h6>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Where the pure earth, <i>baryta</i>, or its solution in
water, is presented for our investigation, it may be
identified by the following reagents.</p>

<p class='c000'>(<i>a</i>) <i>Sulphuric acid, and the soluble sulphates.</i> These
bodies precipitate from the barytic solution, a white
<i>sulphate</i> of the earth, insoluble in water, and nitric
acid.</p>

<p class='c000'>(<i>b</i>) <i>Carbonic acid gas, and the alkaline sub-carbonates</i>,
produce in it a white <i>carbonate of baryta</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>(<i>c</i>) <i>Muriatic acid</i> combines with baryta, and furnishes
a salt which is capable of being identified by
numerous reagents. <i>M. Orfila</i> has furnished us with
the following satisfactory compendium of its habitudes.
“A salt which does not redden the tincture
of tournesol, which does not turn the syrup of violets
green, which is not precipitated by the alkaline hydro-sulphurets,<a id='r336' /><a href='#f336' class='c011'><sup>[336]</sup></a>
nor by ammonia; but which, on
the contrary, is precipitated by the sub-carbonate of
ammonia, soda, or potass; which is not soluble in
concentrated alcohol; which furnishes, with the sulphate
of potass, or the sulphuric acid, a white precipitate
insoluble in water and in the nitric acid, and
which gives with the nitrate of silver a curdled precipitate
of muriate of silver, likewise insoluble in the
nitric acid, <i>can be no other than the muriate of baryta</i>.”</p>

<p class='c000'>But it may happen, that the above salt is so mixed
with alimentary matter, as to defy the action of the
tests; in this case we must endeavour to obtain from
it the pure earth, by precipitating the suspected fluids
<span class='pageno' id='Page_330'>330</span>by the sub-carbonate of ammonia; when a <i>carbonate
of baryta</i> will fall down, which must be dried on a
filter, and calcined with charcoal.</p>

<h4 class='c016'><span class='sc'>Cantharides.</span> <i>Spanish Flies</i>—<i>Blistering Flies</i>. (<i>Cantharis Vesicatoria</i>, Sp. 1, of Latreille.)<a id='r337' /><a href='#f337' class='c011'><sup>[337]</sup></a></h4>

<p class='c014'>Cantharides are imported into this country in their
entire state, and are so kept in the shops; their form
and general appearance are too well known to require
description, and they will rarely become the
objects of inquiry; in powder, however, they may be
presented to us for investigation, and it is therefore
essential that the forensic physician should be acquainted
with the appearances which they assume in
the state of disintegration. This powder has a greenish
colour, tinged with grey, and abounding with
shining points of a very beautiful green colour, and
which may be recognised in whatever state of division
the powder may exist, even after it has passed through
a silken sieve. Its odour is acrid and nauseous; when
thrown on burning coals it emits that peculiar
smell, which generally attends the destruction of animal
matter by heat. The chemical history of <i>cantharides</i>
is still involved in some obscurity; according to
<i>Robiquet</i>, who has furnished us with the most satisfactory
analysis, they contain various fatty principles;
the phosphates of lime, and magnesia; and the
acetic and uric acids; together with a peculiar crystalline
principle, in which the vesicatory properties
wholly reside, and to which the name of <i>cantharidin</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span>has been given by <i>Dr. Thomson</i>.<a id='r338' /><a href='#f338' class='c011'><sup>[338]</sup></a> It may be obtained
in plates, having a micaceous lustre; when
perfectly pure it is insoluble in water, but it is rendered
soluble in that fluid, by the presence of a yellow
matter which exists in native combination with it;
it is very soluble in oils.</p>

<h5 class='c016'><i>Symptoms of poisoning by Cantharides.</i></h5>

<p class='c014'>As this substance forms an article of the materia
medica it may become an accidental source of poisoning;
whilst a general belief in its aphrodisiac
powers may induce a trial of its efficacy, to goad the
exertions of exhausted nature, or to incense the passion
of females, whose seduction is meditated. In
the annals of crime in this country, we are acquainted
with but few instances in which cantharides
have been given with the view of destroying
life; we have already referred<a id='r339' /><a href='#f339' class='c011'><sup>[339]</sup></a> to the case of
<i>Vaux</i>, who was executed for poisoning with cantharides;
there is also that of <i>Sir Thomas Overbury</i>,
who, on the confession of the person who gave
it to him, is said to have taken it, mixed with
his sauces. Cantharides may be administered in
the form of powder, infusion, or tincture. The following
may be considered the more prominent symptoms
which will follow the ingestion of a large dose.
Violent retching; copious alvine evacuations, frequently
bloody; very severe colics; active inflammation
of the stomach and intestines; sometimes universal
convulsions, attended with a horror of liquids,
resembling that which occurs in hydrophobia; furious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_332'>332</span>delirium, &amp;c. But the affections of the urinary passages,
and organs of generation, may be regarded,
κατεξοχην, as the peculiar symptoms of poisoning by
cantharides; such as heat in the bladder, bloody micturition;
horrible strangury; painful and obstinate
priapism; <i>satyriasis</i>, &amp;c. If the dose has not been
sufficient to occasion speedy death, it may produce
marasmus.</p>

<h5 class='c016'><i>Organic lesions discovered on dissection.</i></h5>

<p class='c014'>Where the poison has been administered internally,
we shall find the stomach and intestines presenting
an appearance of inflammation, very similar to that
which we have described as the general result of
corrosive poisons. Marks of inflammatory action,
and sometimes ulceration, will be also discovered in
the urinary and genital organs; especially in those
cases where the person dies shortly after the ingestion
of the poison.</p>

<h5 class='c016'><i>Methods of detecting the presence of Cantharides.</i></h5>

<p class='c014'>Where the poison has been administered in substance,
we shall generally discover some of its particles
mixed with the ejected matter; or, after death,
adhering to the coats of the stomach, or to the folds
of the intestines, and which may be easily identified
by their peculiar green and brilliant hue. If the poison
should have been administered in the form of infusion,
or tincture, our chemical resources will fail
us, and we must rely alone upon the evidence furnished
by the symptoms, and organic lesions.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>
  <h4 class='c016'><span class='sc'>Phosphorus.</span></h4>
</div>

<p class='c014'>This singular substance was accidentally discovered
by <i>Brandt</i>, a chemist of Hamburgh, in the year 1669,<a id='r340' /><a href='#f340' class='c011'><sup>[340]</sup></a>
as he was attempting to extract from human
urine a liquid capable of converting silver into gold.
It was also subsequently discovered by <i>Kunkel</i> and
by <i>Boyle</i>, without these latter chemists having, in
any way, participated in the researches of each other.</p>

<p class='c000'>Phosphorus, when pure, is semi-transparent and
of a yellowish colour; but when kept some time in
water, it becomes opaque externally, and then has a
great resemblance to white wax. Its consistence is
nearly that of wax; it may be cut with a knife. Its
mean specific gravity is 1·770. It generally occurs in
sticks. When exposed to the air, provided the temperature
be not lower than 43°, it emits a white
smoke, which has the smell of garlic, and is luminous
in the dark. This smoke is more abundant, the
higher the temperature is, and is occasioned by the
gradual combustion of the phosphorus. When heated
to 148° it takes fire, and burns with a very bright
flame, and gives out a great quantity of white smoke,
which is phosphoric acid. Oils dissolve phosphorus,
provided the temperature be a little raised. Water
has no effect upon it, unless it be aerated, when it
renders the surface of the phosphorus opaque and
white, which in a short time becomes red. This
change depends upon oxidation.</p>

<h5 class='c016'><i>Symptoms of poisoning by Phosphorus.</i></h5>

<p class='c014'>This substance, whether introduced into the stomach
in its pure form, or dissolved in oil, will occasion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_334'>334</span>the most violent symptoms, from its escharotic
action,<a id='r341' /><a href='#f341' class='c011'><sup>[341]</sup></a> It has been employed in medicine,<a id='r342' /><a href='#f342' class='c011'><sup>[342]</sup></a> in a
state of minute division, in the dose of one-fourth of
a grain, and is said by <i>Leroi</i> to be very efficacious in
restoring and establishing the force<a id='r343' /><a href='#f343' class='c011'><sup>[343]</sup></a> of young persons
exhausted by sensual indulgence, and of even prolonging
the life of the aged.<a id='r344' /><a href='#f344' class='c011'><sup>[344]</sup></a> It has also been
given as a stimulant in local fevers. We are, however,
greatly inclined to question the safety of such a
practice, notwithstanding the diminutiveness of the
dose. The reader will find some interesting cases
of poisoning by phosphorus, translated from the
German work of <i>Weickard</i>, in <i>Hooper’s</i> Medical
Dictionary, under the consideration of that article.
Should such a case present itself for the investigation
of the forensic physician, he will not find any difficulty
in identifying the substance; its external character,
its smell, and, above all, its peculiar property
of yielding luminous vapour, are too palpable
and distinctive, to admit the possibility of error.</p>

<h4 class='c016'><span class='sc'>Mechanical Poisons</span>—<i>Powdered glass</i>—<i>Enamel powder</i>—<i>Chopped hair, &amp;c. &amp;c.</i></h4>

<p class='c014'>We have already examined the pretensions of these
bodies to the rank of corrosive poisons, (<i>page</i> <a href='#Page_145'>145</a>)
and we should have not reverted to the subject, but
from a wish to introduce the account of “<i>a case of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_335'>335</span>Schirrus in the intestines, arising from hairs remaining
in the canal</i>,” as related in the <cite>Edinburgh Medical
Journal</cite>,<a id='r345' /><a href='#f345' class='c011'><sup>[345]</sup></a> by <i>Dr. Burrell</i>, and which had, on the
former occasion, escaped our notice. The subject of
this history, <i>Laurence Harding</i>, æt. 35, being a private
soldier, was admitted into the regimental hospital,
for an unrelenting constipation of the bowels;
but it appears also that he had been affected with
dyspeptic symptoms, and pain in his abdomen, for several
years; which pain was aggravated by the ingestion
of solid food. He received but little benefit from
the remedies that were administered, his strength
gradually declined, and, about a month after his admission,
he expired.</p>

<p class='c000'>“On laying open the abdomen, the stomach was
found much thickened throughout its whole substance,
and the pylorus very much contracted, which contraction
continued down the duodenum. Through
all the intestines this thickening and gristly appearance
was observed. The colon was prodigiously enlarged
in its calibre, until where it forms its sigmoid
flexure; at which point there were three distinct
holes ulcerated through the coats of the intestine,
and forming a communication with the abdominal cavity.
Beyond the sigmoid flexure the intestine was
contracted in its diameter, so as hardly to admit the
little finger to pass downwards. On cutting open the
pylorus and small intestines, the internal coats were
found to be covered with a soft substance, which resembled
size. The internal coats of the colon were
of a dark colour, and in general were completely
ulcerated, and hanging in shreds. The colour of the
colon was of a dark lurid red. At the sigmoid flexure
<span class='pageno' id='Page_336'>336</span>there was much contraction, and the thickening was
so great on one side, and the valve found so considerable,
as hardly to admit a common bougie through
it. The portion forming the sigmoid flexure was cut
out; and on laying it open, and removing some
hardened fæces, <em>five or six hog’s brittles were seen distinctly
crossing each other in different directions</em>; they
were partially invested in the villous coat, which had
grown over them, and which had retained them in
the different positions in which they were placed;
and so firmly were they kept down by those partial
coverings, that it required some force to draw them
out. The mesenteric glands were of a cartilaginous
appearance; the liver was suffused with blood, and
the gall-bladder full of bile. The spleen was very
small, and compressed into an oblong shape, probably
arising from the pressure of the colon when distended
with feculent matter.</p>

<p class='c000'>This man had formerly been a shoemaker. There
was no evidence as to the period at which he swallowed
these hairs; but, from the derangement which
always existed in the bowels, and the pain referred
to the sigmoid flexure, little doubt can be entertained
but that these hairs were the cause of all his complaints,
and ultimately of his death.”</p>

it is susceptible of four degrees of oxidation, presenting

<p class='c000'>Lead, in its metallic state, does not exert any action
on the living system; but, when oxidized, or in
the state of salt, its virulence is very considerable,
producing a train of symptoms, so peculiar to itself,
as to justify our placing its preparations in a separate
class, under the title of <i>astringent</i> poisons, as explained
at page <a href='#Page_202'>202</a>.</p>

<p class='c000'>Metallic lead, although <i>per se</i> inert, may occasion
deleterious effects when introduced into the stomach,
in consequence of its meeting with acids in the <i>primæ
viæ</i>; from the same cause, liquids which are liable to
become in any degree acidulous, if kept in leaden vessels,
may be productive of much danger to those who
drink them. Pure water, provided the air be excluded,
does not appear to exert any sensible action
upon this metal; but the combined influence of
these agents converts the lead into a carbonate: a fact
which is at once exemplified by the white line which
is so constantly visible at the surface of the water preserved
<span class='pageno' id='Page_338'>338</span>in leaden vessels. So well acquainted were
the ancients with this fact, that we find frequent allusions
in their works to the dangerous property of
leaden utensils. <i>Vitruvius</i><a id='r348' /><a href='#f348' class='c011'><sup>[348]</sup></a> published a very strong
remonstrance against leaden pipes, when used for the
purpose of conveying water; and <i>Galen</i> cautions us
continually, not to employ water that has flowed
through pipes of this metal; since he had observed
that the <i>sediment</i> of such water, (υποσταθμη του τουιουτου υδατος)
rendered such as swallowed it, δυσεντερικους, subject to
disorders in the intestines.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Dr. Lambe</i>, to whom we are indebted for an important
work<a id='r349' /><a href='#f349' class='c011'><sup>[349]</sup></a> upon this subject, states, that there
is a great diversity in the corrosive powers of different
waters; in some places the use of leaden pumps has
been in part discontinued, from the expense entailed
upon the proprietors by the perpetual want of repair;<a id='r350' /><a href='#f350' class='c011'><sup>[350]</sup></a>
and if any acidity be communicated to the water,
from the accidental intrusion of decayed leaves or
other vegetable matter, its power of dissolving this
metal will be increased to a very dangerous extent.
The noted colic of Amsterdam is said by <i>Tronchin</i>,
who has written a history of the epidemic, to have
been occasioned by leaves falling and putrefying in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_339'>339</span>leaden cisterns, filled with rain water. <i>Van Swieten</i><a id='r351' /><a href='#f351' class='c011'><sup>[351]</sup></a>
has also related an instance of a whole family who
were afflicted with colic from a similar cause; and
<i>Dr. Lambe</i><a id='r352' /><a href='#f352' class='c011'><sup>[352]</sup></a> entertains no doubt but that the very
striking case recorded in the Medical Commentaries,<a id='r353' /><a href='#f353' class='c011'><sup>[353]</sup></a>
proceeded more from some foulness in the cistern
than from the solvent power of the water; in this instance,
the officers of a packet vessel used water out
of a leaden cistern; the men also drank the same
water, except that the latter had been kept in wood;
the consequence was, that all the officers were seized
with colic, while the men remained healthy. <i>Sir
George Baker</i> has furnished the following striking
illustration of the subject. “The most remarkable
case that now occurs to my memory, is that of <i>Lord
Ashburnham’s</i> family, in Sussex; to which, spring
water was supplied from a considerable distance in
leaden pipes. In consequence, his lordship’s servants
were every year tormented with colic, and some of
them died. An eminent physician of Battle, who
corresponded with me on the subject, sent up some
gallons of that water, which were analysed by <i>Dr.
Higgins</i>, who reported that the water had contained
more than the common quantity of carbonic acid; and
that he found in it lead in solution, which he attributed
to the carbonic acid. In consequence of this
representation, <i>Lord Ashburnham</i> substituted wooden
for leaden pipes; and from that time his family have
experienced no particular complaints in their bowels.”</p>

<p class='c000'>But the most extensive and dangerous source of
poisoning by lead, is the presence of this metal in various
wines, and acescent drinks, and meats, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_340'>340</span>which may arise either from accident or design. A
knowledge of the different avenues, through which
this poison may gain admittance into the human body,
is therefore of great importance to the forensic physician,
and we shall accordingly proceed to the investigation
of the subject.</p>

<p class='c000'>That certain wines were occasionally liable to
produce endemic colics, is a fact which has been long
known; although the disease was universally ascribed
to a mistaken origin, until the publication of the
elaborate researches<a id='r354' /><a href='#f354' class='c011'><sup>[354]</sup></a> of <i>Sir George Baker</i>, into the
cause of the Devonshire colic; which, like the same
disease observed in other countries, was attributed to
the acidity of the liquor so abundantly drunk<a id='r355' /><a href='#f355' class='c011'><sup>[355]</sup></a> in
these districts. This celebrated physician, however,
was early led to entertain doubts with respect to the
truth of this doctrine: “when I consider,” says he,
“that this colic of Devonshire is precisely the same
disease as that which is the specific effect of all saturnine
preparations, and that there is not the least
analogy between the juice of apples and the poison
of lead, it seems to me very improbable that two
causes, bearing so little relation to one another,
should make such similar impressions on the human
body.” The investigation of the subject completely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_341'>341</span>established the justness of these views; and no doubt
remains, but that the endemic colic, which harrassed
the cyder drinkers in Devonshire for some years, was
the effect of saturnine impregnation, derived from the
lead used in the construction of the apple mills and
cyder presses; and in some cases, from the pernicious
practice of introducing a leaden weight into the cask,
or even racking the cyder into leaden cisterns, where
the liquor fretted too much, and was thereby in
danger of becoming acetous. <i>Sir G. Baker</i> also states
that the custom of boiling the <i>must</i> in vessels capped
with lead, affords another source of saturnine impregnation;
and he informs us that, a few years ago,
this very practice produced the <i>Devonshire colic</i> in
the county of Kent. Some cyder, which had been
made in a gentleman’s family, being thought too
sour, was boiled with honey in a brewing vessel,
capped with lead. All, who drank this liquor, were
seized with this disease; some more, others less violently;
one of the servants died very soon in convulsions:
several others were cruelly tortured a long
time. The master of the family, notwithstanding all
the assistance which art could give him, never recovered
his health; but died miserably, after having
for nearly three years languished under a tedious
and incurable malady. <i>Dr. Lambe</i> observes, that
the saturnine colic is not endemial in Devonshire, or
the other cyder countries, during the whole year, but
is confined to those months when the liquor is still
new, crude, and the fermentation incomplete. When
the liquor becomes fine, the noxious matter in a great
measure separates, and is carried to the bottom of
the vessel, as the feculencies subside. Tartar is generated
during the vinous fermentation, the acid of
which, uniting with the lead, forms a salt, scarcely, if
<span class='pageno' id='Page_342'>342</span>at all, soluble in water; and hence the purification
which the liquor receives. But although this new
salt is insoluble in water, it is otherwise in regard to
vinegar; for this acid dissolves a small quantity, and
forms a triple compound, an <i>aceto-tartrate of lead</i>;<a id='r356' /><a href='#f356' class='c011'><sup>[356]</sup></a>
and since no cyder, or perhaps wine, is wholly destitute
of vinegar, it necessarily follows that if the
liquor has been once contaminated during the first
stages of fermentation, it is impossible for it ever to
become entirely pure, except by processes which
would render it unfit for drinking.<a id='r357' /><a href='#f357' class='c011'><sup>[357]</sup></a> It has very
lately been discovered, that <i>Gallic acid</i> and <i>tannin</i>
are capable of combining with lead in solution,
and of forming a perfectly insoluble substance, which
falls to the bottom of the cask; hence all liquors
which have been kept in oak casks, for a certain
time, must be freed from lead. This explains a fact
with respect to the effect of new rum in the West
Indies, of some importance. This spirit, when newly
distilled, is found to contain traces of lead, derived
from the leaden rims of the coppers, and the leaden
worm, used for its condensation; but, by keeping
about twelve months in oaken casks, it loses its deleterious
properties, and no longer exhibits any traces
of this metal.<a id='r358' /><a href='#f358' class='c011'><sup>[358]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Another source, from which acescent liquids may
contract saturnine impregnation, is afforded by the
metallic glazing of earthenware<a id='r359' /><a href='#f359' class='c011'><sup>[359]</sup></a>; that for instance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_343'>343</span>of the common <i>cream coloured</i> ware is composed of an
oxide of lead,<a id='r360' /><a href='#f360' class='c011'><sup>[360]</sup></a> and is accordingly easily acted
upon by vinegar, and saline compounds; jars and
pots of this description ought therefore never to be
used for preserving pickles, jellies of fruits, marmalade,
and similar conserves. For the same reason,
<i>Sir George Baker</i> protests against the custom of baking
fruit tarts in such ware.<a id='r361' /><a href='#f361' class='c011'><sup>[361]</sup></a> <i>Stone ware</i> is glazed
with muriate of soda, and is therefore not liable to
such an objection.<a id='r362' /><a href='#f362' class='c011'><sup>[362]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_344'>344</span>The custom which prevails in some parts of England
of keeping milk in leaden vessels, is extremely
improper; <i>Dr. Darwin</i><a id='r363' /><a href='#f363' class='c011'><sup>[363]</sup></a> has illustrated this subject
by the following case; “A delicate young girl,
the daughter of a dairy farmer, who kept his milk in
leaden cisterns, used to wipe off the cream from the
edges of the lead, and frequently, as she was fond of
cream, licked it from her finger. She was seized
with the saturnine colic, and semi-paralytic wrists,
and sunk from general debility.” We are informed
by <i>Mr. Parkes</i>,<a id='r364' /><a href='#f364' class='c011'><sup>[364]</sup></a> that in Lancashire the dairies are
furnished with milk-pans made of lead; and that when
he expostulated with some individuals on the danger
of this practice, he was told that <i>leaden</i> milk pans
throw up the cream much better than vessels of any
other kind.</p>

<p class='c000'>There is, says <i>Dr. Darwin</i>, a bad custom in almost
all families, and public houses, of washing out their
wine bottles by putting a handful of shot corns into
them, and by shaking them about forcibly to detach
the super-tartrate of potass from their sides; that such
a practice may occasionally give origin to serious
consequences, will become evident by the relation of
the following case.<a id='r365' /><a href='#f365' class='c011'><sup>[365]</sup></a> “A gentleman who had never
in his life experienced a day’s illness, and who was
constantly in the habit of drinking half a bottle of
Madeira after his dinner, was taken ill three hours
after dinner with a serious pain in the stomach and
violent colic, which gradually yielded within twelve
hours to the remedies prescribed by his medical
attendant. The day following he drank the remainder
of the same bottle of wine which was left the preceding
<span class='pageno' id='Page_345'>345</span>day, and within two hours afterwards he was
again seized with the most violent pains, head-ache,
shiverings, and great pain over the whole body. His
apothecary becoming suspicious that the wine he had
drunk might be the cause of the disease, ordered the
bottle, from which it had been decanted, to be
brought to him, with a view that he might examine
the dregs, if any were left. The bottle happening to
slip out of the hand of the servant, disclosed a row of
shot, wedged forcibly into the angular bent-up circumference
of it. On examining the beads of shot, they
crumbled into dust, the outer crust (defended by a
coat of black lead with which the shot is glazed)
being alone left unacted on, whilst the remainder of
the metal was dissolved. The wine, therefore, had
become contaminated with <i>lead</i>, and perhaps <i>arsenic</i>,
for in order to form shot the former metal is alloyed
with the latter.”<a id='r366' /><a href='#f366' class='c011'><sup>[366]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>But we have, hitherto, only directed the reader’s
attention to the different sources from which wine,
and acescent liquors, may <em>accidentally</em> derive saturnine
impregnation. We have now to state that such
liquors have, in different ages and countries, been
fraudulently adulterated with lead. It appears to
have been early discovered, that wines which have
become morbidly acescent may be corrected by the
addition of lead; whence, in those countries where
Rhenish, Moselle, and other similar wines are drunk,
the saturnine colic has been endemic. The celebrated
colic which raged in the province of <i>Poitou</i>, towards
the end of the sixteenth, and in the beginning of the
seventeenth century, was evidently the effect of such
<span class='pageno' id='Page_346'>346</span>adulteration.<a id='r367' /><a href='#f367' class='c011'><sup>[367]</sup></a> We find that, in the year 1487,
there was a <i>Recessus Imperii</i> promulgated at Rotenberg;
and, in the year 1498, at Friberg; which was
enacted, in the year 1500, at Tubingen; and, in the
year 1508, at Frankfort; and, in the year 1577, in
the same place. By which decrees it was made a capital
crime to adulterate wines with <i>litharge</i>, or to
use <i>bismuth</i> in the fumigation of them; it having
been, at several periods, represented to the Emperors,
that great mischief had accrued from such
adulterations; and that they had been the cause of
insuperable and mortal diseases. It should seem,
that these laws were not carried into strict execution;
and, indeed, that in the latter end of the seventeenth
century, it was hardly known in Germany that such
laws existed. In consequence of which, an epidemic
colic arose, which was at length traced to the effects
of lead in the wines.<a id='r368' /><a href='#f368' class='c011'><sup>[368]</sup></a> A representation of this
fact having been made to the <i>Duke of Wirtemberg</i>,
it was ordained a capital crime to mix litharge with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_347'>347</span>wine, or even to sell it in the shops, by a decree,
bearing date March 10, 1696. But, notwithstanding
the severity of this law, we are informed by <i>Zeller</i>,
that in the year 1705, the same dangerous experiments
were repeated in the circle of <i>Zwaabe</i>, with a
view to correct the acidity of the weaker wines.
<i>Bishop Watson</i><a id='r369' /><a href='#f369' class='c011'><sup>[369]</sup></a> informs us that, in the year 1750,
the <i>Farmers general</i> in France being astonished at the
great quantities <i>de vin gaté</i> which were brought into
Paris, in order to be made into vinegar, redoubled
their researches to find out the cause of the great increase
in that article; for nearly thirty thousand
hogsheads had been annually brought in for a few
years preceding the year 1750, whereas the quantity
annually brought in forty years before, did not exceed
1200 hogsheads. They discovered that several
wine merchants, assuming the name of vinegar merchants,
bought these sour wines, and afterwards, by
means of litharge, rendered them potable, and sold
them as genuine wines.<a id='r370' /><a href='#f370' class='c011'><sup>[370]</sup></a> <i>Dr. Warren</i><a id='r371' /><a href='#f371' class='c011'><sup>[371]</sup></a> has related
the cases of thirty-two persons in the <i>Duke of
Newcastle’s</i> family, who were residing in Hanover in
June, 1752, and were seized with the <i>Colica Pictonum</i>,
after having used, as their common drink, a
small white wine that has been adulterated with lead.
Nor has the English vintner been less regardless of the
health of his employer. In a popular work on wine
making by <i>Graham</i>,<a id='r372' /><a href='#f372' class='c011'><sup>[372]</sup></a> which has gone through six
editions, and may therefore be supposed to have done
<span class='pageno' id='Page_348'>348</span>some mischief, we find under the article of <i>vintner’s
secrets</i>, the following receipts.—</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>“<i>To hinder wine from turning</i>,</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>“Put a pound of melted lead, in fair water, into a
cask, pretty warm, and stop it close.”</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>“<i>To soften green wine</i>,</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>“Put in a little vinegar, wherein litharge has been
well steeped, and boil some honey to draw out the
wax. Strain it through a cloth, and put a quart of
it into a tierce: and this will mend it, in summer
especially.”</p>

<p class='c000'>We have already alluded to the presence of lead<a id='r373' /><a href='#f373' class='c011'><sup>[373]</sup></a>
in the <em>new</em> rum of the West Indies, as the cause
of the disease known in that country by the name of
the <i>dry belly-ache</i>; it remains for us to state that the
excise officers frequently avail themselves of the peculiar
power of the <i>sub-acetate of lead</i> to precipitate
colouring matter, in order to remove from seized
Holland gin, the colour which it obtains by being
long kept in the tubs in which it is smuggled over.
A practice which it is said renders the gin liable to
gripe.</p>

<p class='c000'>According to the important experiments of <i>Proust</i>,<a id='r374' /><a href='#f374' class='c011'><sup>[374]</sup></a>
it appears, that if lead be associated with tin, it
will be incapable of furnishing to acids any saturnine
impregnation. The following are the interesting conclusions
at which this philosopher has arrived, viz.</p>

<p class='c000'>“That the <i>tinning</i>, which contains even so large a
proportion as an equal part of lead, cannot be dangerous;
since it is sufficient that the lead should be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_349'>349</span>combined with tin, in order to prevent it from being
dissolved, either in lemon juice, or vinegar, the two
acids most to be feared. The tin, being more oxidable
than the lead, dissolves exclusively in these
acids, and prevents the second from being attacked.
<i>The lead cannot appropriate to itself an atom of oxygen,
but the tin would carry it off in an instant.</i>”</p>

<h4 class='c016'><span class='sc'>Sugar of Lead</span>—<i>Saccharum Saturni</i>—<i>Cerussa Acetata</i>—<i>Plumbi Super-acetas</i>.</h4>

<p class='c014'>This salt of lead, to whose presence the numerous
accidental maladies above enumerated are to be chiefly
attributed, occurs in commerce in the form of irregular
masses resembling lumps of sugar, being an aggregation
of acicular four-sided prisms terminated by
dihedral summits; its taste is sweet and astringent.
It is soluble in 25 parts of water, hot, or cold; when
common spring water, however, is employed for
such a purpose, a white precipitate occurs from the
presence of a certain proportion of <i>sulphates</i> and <i>carbonates</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>When this salt is exposed to the action of heat, it
undergoes aqueous fusion, then dries, and at length
is decomposed, leaving a globule of metallic lead,
mixed with the yellow protoxide, and an acid product
of a fetid smell. This decomposition is similar
to that which vegetable substances undergo when
heated for some time. The quantity of metallic lead,
thus obtained, will be more considerable if the salt
has been previously mixed with charcoal, and particularly
if it be submitted for a long time to the action
of a powerful heat. The strong sulphuric acid of
commerce, when poured upon <i>sugar of lead</i> in powder,
decomposes it with effervescence, and disengages
vapours of acetic acid.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_350'>350</span>This must be considered as an active preparation,
and may, when administered in doses of a few drachms,
speedily occasion death. At the same time, like
other poisons, it may by judicious administration,
become a valuable remedy. See <cite>Pharmacologia</cite>, art.
<i>Plumbi Super-acetas</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>In consequence of the sweet taste of this salt,
children have been induced to swallow it.</p>

<h4 class='c016'><span class='sc'>Goulard’s Extract.</span> <i>Liquor Plumbi Sub-acetatis.</i></h4>

<p class='c014'>This liquor is a saturated solution of the <i>sub-acetate
of lead</i>. Spring water, from the salts which it
contains, produces with it a very milky and turbid
appearance; and even when <em>distilled</em>, in consequence
of the carbonic acid diffused through it, it will occasion
precipitation. It is principally used as an external
application to diminish inflammation, an effect
which it probably produces by paralysing the nerves
of the part. Cases have occurred where this lotion
has been accidentally swallowed, and the usual symptoms
of saturnine poisoning have supervened. How
far its external application may be capable of occasioning
mischief, will form a subject of inquiry under
the consideration of the physiological action of the
preparations of lead.</p>

<h4 class='c016'><span class='sc'>White Lead.</span> <i>Sub-Carbonate of Lead.</i> <i>Cerusse.</i></h4>

<p class='c014'>The substance, known in commercial language by
the name of <i>White Lead</i>, has received at different
times, very various appellations, in consequence of
the fluctuating opinions which have prevailed respecting
its composition. Thus it has been successively
styled a <i>sub-acetate</i>, an <i>oxide</i>, and a <i>sub-carbonate</i>;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_351'>351</span>of which the last is unquestionably the correct name.
In the large way it is prepared by exposing sheets of
metallic lead to the fumes of vinegar. The sub-carbonate
so produced appears as a white, brittle, and
scaly substance, on the surface of the lead; which is
scraped off, and afterwards ground in mills fitted for
the purpose. Formerly, it was ground dry, and the
workmen suffered severely from the operation; it is
now ground in water, and the sub-carbonate is afterwards
dried in earthen pans placed in stoves, heated
by means of flues; still, however, persons employed
in grinding white lead, as well as painters<a id='r375' /><a href='#f375' class='c011'><sup>[375]</sup></a> who
are constantly using it, occasionally suffer severely,
from the want of cleanliness in not washing their
hands before eating, by which some of the white lead
is introduced into the stomach with their food.</p>

<h4 class='c016'><span class='sc'>Litharge.</span> <i>Semi-vitrified Oxide of Lead.</i></h4>

<p class='c014'>This is a yellow protoxide of lead, which has been
melted, and left to crystallize by cooling. It is in
the form of small reddish, or yellowish scales, which
are brilliant and vitrified. Its character is so peculiar
that it cannot easily be mistaken. It is employed for
various purposes in the arts, and is the saturnine preparation
more usually selected for the purpose of removing
acidity from wines, as above related.</p>

<p class='c000'>When treated with a muriatic salt, and submitted
to a high temperature, a <i>muriate of lead</i> is produced,
of a bright yellow colour, the brilliancy of which may
be much heightened by grinding it as usual with oil.
In this state it forms the pigment known by the name
<span class='pageno' id='Page_352'>352</span>of <i>Turner’s yellow</i>, or <i>patent yellow</i>.<a id='r376' /><a href='#f376' class='c011'><sup>[376]</sup></a> It is very
poisonous.</p>

<h4 class='c016'><span class='sc'>Red Lead.</span> <i>Minium.</i></h4>

<p class='c014'>This red oxide of lead is easily distinguished by its
colour, weight, and the facility with which it yields
metallic lead, when heated with carbonaceous matter.
Common red wafers, which derive their colour from
this oxide, afford a striking illustration of this fact,
for if burnt in a candle, globules of metallic lead will
be observed to flow from them. It is poisonous;
and we have already alluded to a case where Gloucester
cheese<a id='r377' /><a href='#f377' class='c011'><sup>[377]</sup></a> occasioned deleterious effects, in
consequence of its adulteration with <i>red lead</i>. (p. <a href='#Page_277'>277</a>)
It is destructive also to inferior animals, apparently
in very small quantities; red wafers prove poisonous
to birds who may pick them up; and the same paste
is sold for the purpose of destroying beetles, in which
it succeeds very effectually. Since it is employed as
a pigment, it may on many occasions prove an accidental
cause of poisoning; there is indeed one very
common and dangerous source, mentioned by <i>Sir
George Baker</i>,<a id='r378' /><a href='#f378' class='c011'><sup>[378]</sup></a> which deserves to be particularized
in this place, viz. the practice of painting toys with
<i>red lead</i>, and other poisonous substances; children,
observes this distinguished physician, are apt to carry
every object which gives them delight to their mouths,
the painting of toys, therefore, with poisonous colours,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_353'>353</span>is a practice which ought to be abolished, and
is the more open to censure, as it is of no real utility.</p>

<h5 class='c016'><i>Symptoms of poisoning by the different preparations of Lead.</i></h5>

<p class='c014'>The effects of this poison will vary considerably
according to the quantity swallowed, and the circumstances
under which it is taken. We shall, therefore,
first consider its operation, in doses sufficiently
large to occasion at once violent effects; and then
describe its agency as an <em>accumulative</em> poison, where
it is introduced into the system gradually, and in
small quantities, so as to act slowly and imperceptibly,
and to lay the foundation of irreparable mischief,
before any alarm is occasioned.</p>

<p class='c000'>1. <i>Symptoms which follow a large dose.</i> Where a
salt of lead has been taken in a considerable dose, the
patient soon experiences excruciating pains in the
abdomen, accompanied with sickness and vomiting;
the colic increases to a violent degree, but admits of
temporary alleviation by pressure, a circumstance
which at once distinguishes it from the effects of corrosive
poison. Although it is necessary to observe,
that inflammatory symptoms may afterwards occur,
where the dose has been very considerable, and the
consequences direct and speedy.</p>

<p class='c000'>The patient describes the pain as if produced by a
boring instrument, and the abdominal muscles become
knotted, and sometimes painfully retracted with
all the contents of the abdomen towards the spine.<a id='r379' /><a href='#f379' class='c011'><sup>[379]</sup></a>
The sphincter muscles of the bladder and anus are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_354'>354</span>always affected; sometimes strangury and tenesmus
are the consequences; at other times, a total incapacity
of making any water at all, and so great a contraction
of the sphincter ani that a clyster can hardly
be introduced. After suffering these torments for a
period of an indefinite duration, delirium and cold
sweats may supervene, and the patient die in convulsions.
If, however, the treatment has been prompt
and judicious, and the quantity of poison has not
been excessive, he may recover from its immediate
effects, and live to testify the severity of the consecutive
phenomena. A most inveterate constipation of
the bowels will continue for a considerable period,
and there will be an occasional recurrence of colic;
at length a peculiar species of palsy will supervene in
the upper extremities, especially affecting the muscles
of the fore arm, and wrist,<a id='r380' /><a href='#f380' class='c011'><sup>[380]</sup></a> <i>Citois</i> has given
us a striking description of this stage of the saturnine
disease. “<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Per vicos, veluti larvæ, aut arte progredientes
statuæ, pallidi, squalidi, macilenti conspiciuntur,
manibus incurvis et suo pondere pendulis, nec nisi
arte ad os et cæteras supernas partes sublatis, ac pedibus
non suis, sed crurum muculis, ad ridiculum, ni
miserandum, incessum compositis, voce clangosa et
strepera.</span></i>” It does not appear that the train of symptoms
above described has ever been excited by any
other external cause than the one here assigned.
Whenever we meet with colic, attended with paralytic
symptoms of the extremities, we may at once
conclude that it has arisen from the influence of lead.</p>

<p class='c000'>The disease has been described by authors under
<span class='pageno' id='Page_355'>355</span>the name of the <i>colic of Poitou</i>,<a id='r381' /><a href='#f381' class='c011'><sup>[381]</sup></a> or <i>colica Pictonum</i>,<a id='r382' /><a href='#f382' class='c011'><sup>[382]</sup></a>
from the circumstance of its having raged with such
epidemic fury in that province, in consequence of the
adulteration of its wines with lead. It is also mentioned
as the painter’s colic, since this class of artists
is very commonly visited by the disease, in consequence
of the <i>white lead</i> contained in their pigments.
At the Lead Hills, it is known to the miners, under
the provincial name of <i>milreek</i>; and in Derbyshire,
under that of <i>belland</i>.<a id='r383' /><a href='#f383' class='c011'><sup>[383]</sup></a></p>

<h6 class='c016'>2. <i>Symptoms arising from the introduction of lead into the system, by small and repeated doses.</i></h6>

<p class='c014'>The effects produced upon various artists by the
imperceptible operation of lead, sufficiently shew the
power which this metal possesses of accumulating in
the human system, and it is probable, says <i>Sir George
Baker</i>, that from an observation of such slow, but
certain effects of lead, the French and Italians derived
the hint of preparing their celebrated poisons,
called “<i>Poudres de Succession</i>;”<a id='r384' /><a href='#f384' class='c011'><sup>[384]</sup></a> the basis of
which has been supposed to have been some preparation
of that mineral. <i>Zeller</i> mentions a certain chemical
operator, near the confines of Bohemia, who,
after having diligently applied himself to the composition
of poisons, did, by means of lead, combined
with some more volatile and corrosive substance,
prepare a most slow poison, which given to dogs and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_356'>356</span>other animals, had the power of destroying them,
without producing any violent symptoms, after several
weeks, or even months.<a id='r385' /><a href='#f385' class='c011'><sup>[385]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The following-curious case,<a id='r386' /><a href='#f386' class='c011'><sup>[386]</sup></a> communicated by
<i>Dr. Wall</i>, of Worcester to <i>Sir George Baker</i>, will
serve to illustrate the present subject, and to shew
that lead may gain admittance into the human body,
unobserved, and even unsuspected. “A gentleman
of Worcester was the father of a numerous offspring,
having had one and twenty children, of whom eight
died young, and thirteen survived their parents.
During their infancy, and indeed until they had
quitted the place of their usual residence, they were
all remarkably unhealthy; being particularly subject
to disorders of the stomach and bowels. The father,
during many years, was paralytic; the mother, for
as long a time, subject to colics and bilious obstructions.
She died at last of an obstinate jaundice. This
disease had been several times removed by the use of
the Bath water; but it always came on again soon
after her return to Worcester; and at last eluded
every method and medicine which was tried. After
the death of these parents, the family sold the house
which they had so long inhabited. The purchaser
found it necessary to repair the pump. This was
made of lead; and, upon examination, was found
to be so corroded, that several perforations were observed
in the cylinder, in which the bucket plays;
and the cistern in the upper part was reduced to the
thinness of common brown paper, and was full of
holes like a sieve. The waters of this town are remarkably
<span class='pageno' id='Page_357'>357</span>hard. It is then more than probable that
the water of this pump, thus impregnated with lead,
occasioned the unhealthiness of the family who drank
it. I have been just informed by the plumber,” adds
<i>Dr. Wall</i>, “that he had several times repaired the
pump in question; and that he had done so not
more than three or four years before the gentleman’s
death; when he found it nearly in the same
state as it has been described; so that the corrosion
was effected in a short time; and consequently
the water must have been very strongly impregnated
with the noxious quality of the metal.”</p>

<h5 class='c016'><i>Organic lesions discovered on dissection.</i></h5>

<p class='c014'>The reports of the dissection of those who have been
destroyed by saturnine poisons are far from being satisfactory.
Where the person has died from the primary
effects of a large dose of the acetate of lead, the
stomach has betrayed a state of inflammation, similar
to that which results from the action of a corrosive
poison; black points and spots, from venous extravasation,
have been also observed in the interior of
this viscus; <i>M. Orfila</i> states that he has seen in the
stomach of animals who have taken a large dose of
the acetate of lead, and have not vomited, a membraneous
lining tolerably thick, of an ash colour,
easily detaching in small pieces; the origin of which
appeared to be owing to the decomposition of a part
of the acetate of lead by the mucous, bilious, and
other fluids, contained in this viscus. The mucous
membrane lying under this lining, was of a dark grey
colour throughout its whole thickness, and appeared
to have exercised the same action on the acetate of
lead. The case is very different in those who have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_358'>358</span>died from the slow action of this metal; all anatomists
agree in reporting, that in the <i>colica pictonum</i>, the
digestive canal exhibits no vestige of inflammation;<a id='r387' /><a href='#f387' class='c011'><sup>[387]</sup></a>
but the diameter of the large intestines, especially
that of the colon, is generally contracted; thus displaying
the effects of that operation, which is supposed
to be characteristic of the compounds of lead,
and which has bestowed upon them the peculiar designation
of <i>astringent</i> poisons. <i>Foderé</i> states that the
mesentery and its glands; and the lacteal and lymphatic
vessels, are inflamed and obstructed, and the thoracic
duct almost obliterated; the liver, spleen, pancreas,
and lungs often inflamed, tumefied and purulent,
and even the heart shrivelled;<a id='r388' /><a href='#f388' class='c011'><sup>[388]</sup></a> and the
whole body, in consequence of the constriction of
the chyliferous vessels, in a state of complete marasmus.
Upon this passage <i>Orfila</i> makes the following
observation. “We are under the necessity of declaring,
that almost all these signs are wanting in the
majority of the cases of simple colic of lead, terminated
by death.” <i>Fourcroy</i>, in a note to his translation
of <i>Ramazzini</i>, “<cite>De Morbis Artificum</cite>,” observes
that the intestines have, in these cases, been discovered
distended by air, parched, and slightly altered
in colour; and that in the larger ones, balls of dry,
dark coloured, excrementitious matter, have been
found.</p>

<h5 class='c016'><i>Physiological action of Lead Poisons.</i></h5>

<p class='c014'>The preparations of lead seem to act upon the nervous
system, destroying its energy, and thereby producing
paralysis. Whether this is effected through
<span class='pageno' id='Page_359'>359</span>the medium of the circulation, or whether they produce
their effects without being absorbed, appears to
us to be a question which has not hitherto received a
satisfactory answer. It must, however, be admitted
that they act upon the alimentary canal, by coming
into contact with its nerves; and in some cases,
where the dose of the <i>acetate</i> has been large, it may
have produced death by the local injury which it inflicted.
<i>Dr. Lambe</i> observes upon this subject, that
“certain facts render it probable that lead does not
operate entirely through the medium of the circulation,
nor by nervous sympathy; but also topically,
affecting the part to which it is applied more than the
other parts of the body.” This latter position is
clearly established by the beneficial effects occasioned
by the topical application of lead to inflamed surfaces;
nor can any doubt exist as to the fact of such applications
having produced local paralysis. There is a
paper in the third volume of the <cite>Medical Transactions</cite>
by <i>Dr. Reynolds</i>, in which the case of a gentleman
is detailed, who brought on a temporary paralysis of
the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">sphincter ani</span></i>, by freely using <i>Goulard’s</i> lotion for
the cure of piles. Foreign writers have also maintained
that saturnine applications have frequently occasioned
impotence; for further information upon
this subject the reader may refer to <cite>Istitutione di Medicina
Forens: di Tortosa</cite>, <i>vol.</i> 1, <i>p.</i> 58; also <cite>Fritze
Compend: sopra i Malat. Vener.</cite> <i>p.</i> 189; and <cite>Monteggia
Annotat. sopra i Mali Venerei</cite>, <i>p.</i> 36. <i>Sir
George Baker</i> states that he has some reason to doubt,
whether <i>litharge</i>, the common basis of our plasters,
when used for the purpose of dressing issues, has not,
in certain irritable constitutions, produced some of
the ordinary effects of saturnine preparations taken
internally. There have been instances of children
<span class='pageno' id='Page_360'>360</span>thrown into convulsions, by <i>cerusse</i>, sprinkled on
excoriated parts. <i>Zeller</i> quotes, on the authority of
<i>Molingius</i>, a remarkable instance of the pernicious
effects of <i>litharge</i>, externally applied.<a id='r389' /><a href='#f389' class='c011'><sup>[389]</sup></a> <i>Sir George
Baker</i> met with a most violent and obstinate colic,
which seemed to have been occasioned by some
litharge, mixed in a cataplasm, and applied to the
<i>vagina</i>, with a view to allay a troublesome itching;
and he says that he was informed by <i>Dr. Petit</i> that
<i>Goulard’s poultice</i> applied for some time to a patient’s
knee, in St. George’s hospital, occasioned violent
pain in the bowels, which did not cease until the
poultice had been removed; nor are authorities deficient
to prove, that the fashionable application of
<i>cerusse</i> to the skin has been followed by obstinate colics,
pains, and tremors. We have been desirous of
laying before our readers the above authorities, in
proof of the constitutional effects which may be occasionally
produced by the external application of lead,
since the fact has been questioned, and is still considered
by many as involved in doubt and uncertainty.
<i>Dr. Lambe</i> is inclined to believe, that “to the production
of the saturnine colic, it is necessary that the
metal should be applied <em>immediately</em> to the stomach
and intestines.” If this hypothesis be just, he excludes
nervous sympathy, as well as absorption, as a
proximate cause of saturnine colic; and, consequently,
no dependence can be placed on the accounts given
by the above pathologists with regard to the production
<span class='pageno' id='Page_361'>361</span>of such an effect by lotions and cataplasms of
lead.</p>

<h5 class='c016'><i>Of the chemical processes, by which the presence of lead may be detected.</i></h5>

<p class='c014'>These will necessarily vary according to the different
states of combination in which it may be supposed
to exist; we shall, therefore, proceed to consider the
modes of establishing its presence, 1, In solution in
<i>water</i>; <i>wine</i>; <i>spirit</i>; and <i>oils</i>. 2. In a state of mixture
with <i>various solids</i>. 3. Combined with <i>solid or
liquid aliments</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>1. <i>The lead exists in some unknown state of combination
in solution in water.</i> We are greatly indebted
to <i>Dr. Lambe</i><a id='r390' /><a href='#f390' class='c011'><sup>[390]</sup></a> for the able directions which he has
afforded us for ascertaining the presence of minute
portions of lead in water; and we recommend the
practitioner, who may be engaged in such an investigation,
to peruse his work with attention. The following
are the reagents through which our analysis
must be conducted.</p>

<p class='c000'>(<i>a</i>) <i>Sulphuretted hydrogen.</i> A solution of this gas
in distilled water is a very delicate test for lead,
throwing down a precipitate of a very dark brown colour,
approaching to black. The competency, however,
of this test to the discovery of very minute
quantities of lead, in certain states of combination,
has been questioned by <i>Dr. Lambe</i>; who was enabled
to detect the presence of this metal, by other methods,
in water that manifested no indication with
<i>sulphuretted hydrogen</i>. He detected it, for instance,
in the precipitate occasioned in such water by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_362'>362</span>carbonate of potass or soda. In operating on these
waters, he noticed the following appearances.</p>

<p class='c015'>1. <i>The precipitate, produced as above stated, when
re-dissolved in nitric acid, formed a dark cloud
with sulphuretted hydrogen.</i></p>
<p class='c015'>2. <i>Although the sulphuretted hydrogen formed no
cloud, the precipitate itself became darkened by
it.</i></p>
<p class='c015'>3. <i>The precipitate re-dissolved in nitric acid</i>, (as
in 1) <i>formed, with sulphuretted hydrogen, a
white cloud.</i></p>
<p class='c015'>4. <i>Sulphuretted hydrogen neither formed a cloud,
nor darkened the precipitate.</i></p>
<p class='c015'>5. <i>In the cases 2, 3, 4, if the precipitate be heated
to redness, in contact with an alkaline carbonate;
and after dissolving out the carbonate, it be redissolved
in nitric acid; then sulphuretted hydrogen
will form a dark cloud with the solution.</i>
In these experiments it is necessary that the
acid used to redissolve the precipitate be not
in excess; if it should so happen, the excess
must be saturated, before the test is applied.
It is better to use so little, that some precipitate
may remain undissolved. The nitric acid,
used in these experiments, should be perfectly
pure; and the sulphuretted hydrogen test
should be recently prepared by saturating distilled
water with the gas.</p>

<p class='c000'>(<i>b</i>) <i>Sulphate of soda, or potass.</i> This test will produce
a white precipitate in water, containing one
hundred-thousandth of its weight of lead; and is considered
by <i>Dr. Thomson</i> as the most unequivocal reagent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_363'>363</span>of that metal which we possess. “The precipitate
is a fine dense powder, which speedily falls to
the bottom, and is not re-dissolved by nitric acid;
no other precipitate can be confounded with it, except
<i>sulphate of baryta</i>, and there is no chance of the
presence of baryta in solution in water.”<a id='r391' /><a href='#f391' class='c011'><sup>[391]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>(<i>c</i>) <i>Muriate of soda.</i> One of the methods of analysis
proposed by <i>Dr. Lambe</i>, consists in precipitating
the lead by common salt; but as the <i>muriate of
lead</i> is partly soluble in water, this test cannot be applied
to small portions of suspected water. The precipitate
must, therefore, be collected from two or
three gallons, and heated to redness with twice its
weight of carbonate of soda. The alkaline carbonate
is then to be dissolved out, and nitric acid added, in
order to saturate any superfluity; the <i>sulphuretted
hydrogen</i> test will then produce its indication.</p>

<p class='c000'>(<i>d</i>) <i>Reduction of the metal.</i> This is undoubtedly
the most satisfactory of all the tests; and, except the
trouble of collecting a large quantity of precipitate, is
not embarrassed with any difficulty. The precipitate
may be mixed with its own weight of alkaline carbonate,
and exposed either with, or without, the addition
of a small proportion of charcoal, to a heat sufficient
to melt the alkali. On breaking the crucible, a
small globule of lead will be found reduced at the
bottom. The precipitate from about fifty gallons of
water yielded <i>Dr. Lambe</i> about two grains of lead.</p>

<p class='c000'>2. <i>The lead is dissolved in wine.</i> For the detection
of this dangerous fraud, the reagent invented by <i>Dr.
Hahnemann</i> affords a ready and convenient test. It
consists of water saturated with sulphuretted hydrogen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_364'>364</span>gas, and acidulated with muriatic acid;<a id='r392' /><a href='#f392' class='c011'><sup>[392]</sup></a> this
latter ingredient is added for the purpose of preventing
the precipitation of any iron, which the wine
might accidentally contain. This liquor will, if
added in the proportion of one part to two of wine,
produce with the smallest quantity of lead, a dark
coloured, or black precipitate; which, if collected,
dried, and fused before the blow-pipe on a piece of
charcoal, will yield a globule of metallic lead. Or
we may modify the experiment by passing a current of
sulphuretted hydrogen gas through the wine, having
previously acidulated it with muriatic acid, to prevent
the precipitation of the iron.</p>

<p class='c000'>A farther proof of the presence of lead in wines is
the occurrence of a precipitate, on adding a solution
of the sulphate of soda.</p>

<p class='c000'>The most satisfactory proof, however, is derived
by distilling off the alcohol, and calcining the residuum
with charcoal, in order to obtain the metallic
lead.</p>

<p class='c000'>The quantity of lead which has been detected in
sophisticated wine, may be estimated at forty grains
of the metal in every fifty gallons,<a id='r393' /><a href='#f393' class='c011'><sup>[393]</sup></a> but this will of
course be liable to vary with the degree of acidity it
was intended to correct.</p>

<p class='c000'>3. <i>The lead is dissolved in oils.</i> In this case the
lead may be detected by shaking, in a stopped phial,
one part of the suspected oil, with two or three parts
<span class='pageno' id='Page_365'>365</span>of water, impregnated with <i>sulphuretted hydrogen</i>.
This test will announce the presence of the deleterious
metal, by occasioning a dark brown, or black
colour.</p>

<p class='c000'>4. <i>The lead is mixed with alimentary matter.</i> <i>M.
Orfila</i> has furnished us with the following directions
for assaying the matter vomited, or that which may
be found in the digestive canal, after death. “After
having expressed the fluid portion through a piece of
fine linen, it must be assayed by the <em>tests</em>, which have
been already enumerated as being capable of detecting
the salts of lead; and if the precipitates obtained
are of a nature to induce a belief, that the fluid contains
some preparation of this kind, it must be evaporated
to dryness, and calcined with charcoal in a crucible;
when, at the expiration of three quarters of an
hour, metallic lead will be obtained. If all the experiments
made on the fluid portion of the matter vomited,
for the discovery of this poison, should be
fruitless, the whole of the solid portions, previously
dried, should then be calcined with potass and charcoal,
by which means metallic lead will be obtained.”</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_366'>366</span>
  <h4 class='c016'>VEGETABLE POISONS.</h4>
</div>

<p class='c014'>The poisons of which we are about to offer the
physiological and chemical history, although more
numerous than those which belong to the mineral
kingdom, are, notwithstanding, of far less importance
in a forensic point of view. With the exception
of opium, and some few others, they must be considered
as objects of accidental, rather than of criminal
poisoning; and even with respect to the former
narcotic, it may be said to afford more frequently the
means of destruction to the suicide, than to the
assassin.</p>

<p class='c000'>The sensible qualities of smell, taste, and sometimes
colour, which so eminently characterise deleterious
plants, must necessarily render them ill calculated
to favour that secresy, which constitutes the
indispensable companion of crime; while their bulk,
and the pharmaceutical preparation which they require,
are alike inconsistent with the hope of concealment.</p>

<p class='c000'>Thus we receive, as it were, from Nature, that
protection which art can no longer supply; and the
commission of crime is either prevented or discovered,
in cases where the powers of chemistry would
fail in its detection.</p>

<p class='c000'>The objects which constitute the vegetable kingdom
differ from every species of mineral matter, not only in
their peculiar organized structure, but in the chemical
arrangement of their elements; those of inorganic
matter are generally combined in very simple proportions,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_367'>367</span>as one and one, or one and two, &amp;c. whereas
in organized bodies, their proportions are much
more complicated; and <i>Dr. Ure</i> observes,<a id='r394' /><a href='#f394' class='c011'><sup>[394]</sup></a> that
such substances derive the peculiar delicacy of their
chemical equilibrium, and the consequent facility
with which it may be subverted and new modelled,
to the multitude of atoms grouped together in a compound;
hence too, as <i>Mr. Children</i><a id='r395' /><a href='#f395' class='c011'><sup>[395]</sup></a> has observed,
is one reason of our utter inability to reproduce even
the simplest body of this class, when once its elements
have been separated; it is not in the diversity
of these elements, but in the manner in which they
are grouped, that this peculiarity consists, for, continues
the accomplished chemist last mentioned, “vegetable
substances seldom contain, as essential, more
than three principles—<i>oxygen</i>, <i>hydrogen</i>, and <i>carbon</i>,
and sometimes <i>azote</i>. With four simple elements
then, a brief alphabet for so comprehensive a history!
has a bountiful Omnipotence composed the beautiful
volume of the living world, where, turn to what page
we may, fresh loveliness meets the eye, fresh cause
of admiration and delight.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The analysis of vegetable bodies resolves itself into
two parts, each of which constitutes an equal object
of interest to the forensic physician; who, it will be
shewn, may occasionally derive important information
from both. The first relates to the discovery of the
<i>proximate</i> principles of a vegetable substance. The
second, to that of its <i>ultimate</i> elements. By the <i>proximate</i>,
or, as they are sometimes termed, the <i>immediate</i>
principles, we mean those compound substances
which exist in the living plant in a state identical
<span class='pageno' id='Page_368'>368</span>with that, under which chemical processes exhibit
them, and are chiefly separable by the action of different
solvents. The number of these principles is
considerable, as <i>gum</i>, <i>starch</i>, <i>sugar</i>, <i>gluten</i>, <i>extractiue</i>,
<i>tannin</i>, <i>oils</i>, <i>acid</i>, <i>&amp;c. &amp;c.</i> By the <i>ultimate</i> elements,
we understand those, of which the <i>proximate</i>
are composed, as <i>oxygen</i>, <i>hydrogen</i>, <i>carbon</i>, and
<i>azote</i>. In submitting a plant to destructive analysis,
for the purpose of obtaining its ultimate elements, we
shall derive compounds, which formed no part of the
vegetable structure, and which result from a new
arrangement of the elements composing it; <i>acetic</i> and
<i>carbonic acids</i>, for example, are obtained by the destructive
distillation of several vegetable substances,
in which neither of these acids existed ready formed,
but only their elements.<a id='r396' /><a href='#f396' class='c011'><sup>[396]</sup></a> It may easily be imagined
to what numerous fallacies such a law of composition
must have given origin, in the earlier periods
of chemical inquiry; and it is equally evident,
that the utmost refinement of chemical science, and
the most rigorous methods of analysis, will be required
to enable us to deduce any satisfactory conclusion
with respect to the quality of a plant, from
these data. Such perfection, indeed, has not hitherto
been attained, but the period is probably not far distant,
when our most sanguine anticipations upon this
point may be realised. We have only to trace the
history of this branch of chemistry for the last century,
to become satisfied of its gradual and important
progress towards such an epoch, and of the improvements
of which this department of vegetable analysis is
farther susceptible; let us, for the sake of illustration,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_369'>369</span>only compare the rude results obtained by the
academicians of Paris, at about the commencement of
the seventeenth century, with those of <i>MM. Gay-Lussac</i>
and <i>Thenard</i><a id='r397' /><a href='#f397' class='c011'><sup>[397]</sup></a>, or with those, very lately
instituted in this country by <i>Dr. Ure</i>,<a id='r398' /><a href='#f398' class='c011'><sup>[398]</sup></a> and we
shall perceive that while the former of these experimentalists,
by the aid of heat, were unable to form
the slightest distinction between the most inert, and
the most poisonous species of plants, the latter, by
means of the same agent, aided by the modern doctrine
of equivalent ratios, has succeeded in establishing
the proportions in which the elements of each
vegetable body combines; and with such accuracy, as
to discriminate between substances, which bear the
greatest analogy to each other; as between the varieties
of sugar, and those of oil; and even between
common flax, and the same substance prepared according
to the improved process of <i>Mr. Lee</i>. This
statement is sufficient to show the capability of ultimate
analysis, on certain occasions, to identify vegetable
bodies; but we are, at present, scarcely advanced
far enough in such an investigation, to make
it subservient to the detection of vegetable poisons.
Nor has our knowledge with regard to proximate
analysis, been less successfully advanced. The late
researches of the French and German chemists have
demonstrated the existence of several new alkaline
bodies in the class of vegetable poisons, to which
some of these plants appear to be exclusively indebted
for their activity, as the <i>poppy</i>, <i>hellebore</i>,
<i>colchicum</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i>; and whose characters are so distinct
and striking, as to enable the chemist to recognise
<span class='pageno' id='Page_370'>370</span>their presence by appropriate re-agents. In other
cases, the virulence of a plant would appear to depend
upon the combination of several<a id='r399' /><a href='#f399' class='c011'><sup>[399]</sup></a> proximate
principles; while in some few instances there exist in
the same individual vegetable, two distinct elements
of activity, as illustrated by the interesting history of
tobacco.</p>

<p class='c000'>In cases of vegetable poisoning it will occasionally
occur, that some remains of the plant may be collected;
and seeds, portions of the fungi, and leaves, may be
found in the contents of the stomach; whence a knowledge
of botany becomes indispensable. This branch
of science is, moreover, important to the toxicologist,
as enabling him to pursue the study of plants with
greater precision; for experience has shewn that
there is a wonderful analogy between the structure of
those plants which resemble each other in medicinal
operation. Thus those which, from their dismal and
dusky appearance, have been arranged under the
title of <i>Luridæ</i>, are in general highly poisonous;
they also possess a very peculiar and disagreeable
smell, so that Nature has, upon this occasion, kindly
given us notice of approaching danger, by means of
our senses.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of equal importance with the knowledge of the
generic and specific characters, is that of their sensible
qualities, and the changes which these latter
undergo by pharmaceutical preparation.</p>

add to these the history of its habitudes with different
menstrua, the chemist will have no difficulty in
detecting its presence, viz. when triturated with
water, two-thirds of its substance are speedily dissolved,
and a turbid solution results; alcohol dissolves
nine-tenths, and forms a yellow transparent tincture,
which is rendered turbid by the addition of water;
sulphuric ether dissolves six-tenths of the substance;
it is also soluble in alkaline solutions, and the resulting
compound is not rendered turbid by water, but is
instantly decomposed by acids, and the precipitate so
produced is of an extremely brilliant yellow colour,
and soluble in an excess of acid.</p>

acquainted with any case in which death followed its

local action on the textures, with which it comes in
contact, and it will accordingly be found in the third

<h4 class='c016'><span class='sc'>White Hellebore.</span><a id='r402' /><a href='#f402' class='c011'><sup>[402]</sup></a><br /> <br /><i>Veratrum Album.</i> (Polygamia—Monæcia—<i>Nat. Ord.</i> Coronariæ. <i>Linn.</i>—Junci. <i>Juss.</i>)</h4>

<p class='c014'>This is undoubtedly the true hellebore of the ancients.
It is a native of the mountainous parts of
Greece, Italy, Switzerland, and Russia. Those specimens
which are cultivated in our gardens flower in
July. The root is the only part employed in medicine,
but every part of the plant is extremely acrid
and poisonous. Upon the animal œconomy it acts as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_373'>373</span>a violent cathartic and emetic; producing bloody
stools, excessive vomitings, great anxiety, vertigo,
tremors, sinking of the pulse, syncope, cold sweats,
convulsions, and death. There are many cases on record,
where such effects have followed the ingestion
of this plant. <i>Helmont</i> reports that a royal prince
died in the course of three hours after taking a scruple
of this poison, which induced convulsions; and <i>Vicat</i><a id='r403' /><a href='#f403' class='c011'><sup>[403]</sup></a>
relates the case of a tailor, his wife, children, and
workmen, who having taken soup, in which, through
mistake, the root of white hellebore had been introduced
instead of pepper, were seized with a universal
coldness, and such extreme debility, as to become
nearly insensible. At the expiration of two hours,
the eldest child, who was not four years of age, began
to vomit copiously, but with considerable straining;
the rest were shortly after in the same condition.
<i>Vicat</i>, who was called in at this critical period, ordered
them to take a considerable quantity of warm
water and oil; shortly after which he administered an
infusion of mallow sweetened with honey; by which
means, we are informed, they were relieved, and
ultimately restored. According to the testimony of
various physiologists, as well as from the experiments
of <i>Orfila</i>, it appears that this plant, if externally applied,
will produce the same effects. <i>Etmuller</i> says,
that the external application of the root to the abdomen
will produce vomiting; and <i>Schroeder</i> observed
the same phenomenon to take place in a case where it
was used as a suppository; the juice of the plant has
been also applied to the purpose of poisoning arrows.
It must, therefore, act by being absorbed into the
circulating current, thereby destroying the <a id='ene'></a>energy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_374'>374</span>of the nervous system. It accordingly finds a place
in the second division of our classification. Late experiments
upon this substance have shewn that its
activity depends upon a peculiar alkaline principle, to
which the name of <i>veratria</i><a id='r404' /><a href='#f404' class='c011'><sup>[404]</sup></a> has been given; and
that it exists in native combination with an excess of
gallic acid, (<i>super-gallate of veratria</i>).</p>

<p class='c000'>When taken internally, as a poison, the most effectual
antidote is said to be a very strong infusion of
nut-galls.</p>

<h4 class='c016'><span class='sc'>Black Hellebore.</span> <i>Melampodium.</i><br /> <br /><i>Christmas-rose.</i> (Polyandria Polygynia. <i>Nat. Ord.</i> Multisiliquæ, <i>Linn.</i> Ranunculaceæ, <i>Juss.</i>)</h4>

<p class='c014'>This plant, which has derived its name from the
dark colour of the root, is a native of Austria, the
Apennines, and Italy; it has, however, obtained a
place in our gardens,<a id='r405' /><a href='#f405' class='c011'><sup>[405]</sup></a> and from the circumstance of
its flowering from December till March, it has acquired
the name of the christmas rose. The fibres of
the roots are the parts employed in medicine; their
odour is fœtid, and their taste bitter and acrid. Its
action upon the animal œconomy is similar to that of
the preceding species. <i>Morgagni</i> relates the history
of a person who took half a drachm of black hellebore,
and expired eight hours afterwards. <i>M. Orfila</i>
states that inflammation of the rectum is a constant
occurrence, where the animals who have taken
this root, have survived its administration for a few
hours.</p>

  <h4 class='c016'><span class='sc'>Fœtid Hellebore.</span> <i>Helleborus Fœtidus.</i> <i>Helleboraster.</i></h4>
</div>

<p class='c014'>This plant is a native of England, growing in shady
places, on a chalky soil, and flowering in March and
April. Like the former species of hellebore, it is
capable of producing fatal effects. A case is related
in the <i>London Chronicle</i>, 1768, no. 1760, of a child
who died in consequence of taking the root of this
plant in the pulp of an apple.</p>

<h4 class='c016'><span class='sc'>Elaterium.</span> <i>Wild</i>, or <i>squirting Cucumber</i>.<br /> <br /><i>Momordica Elaterium</i> (Monæcia Monadelphia. <i>Nat. Ord.</i> Cucurbitaceæ.)</h4>

<p class='c014'>This plant is a perennial native of the south of Europe,
flowering in June and July; it is cultivated in
England, but does not survive the severity of our
winters. The fruit (<i>poma</i>) has the appearance of a
small oval cucumber, of a greyish colour, and covered
with prickles. When fully ripe it quits the peduncal,
and casts out the seed and juice, with great force, and
to a considerable distance, through the hole in the
base where the foot-stalk is inserted, whence the
name of <i>squirting</i> cucumber. The author has instituted
numerous experiments upon this plant, the results
of which will be found fully detailed, under its
history, in the fifth edition of his Pharmacologia.</p>

<p class='c000'>The plant appears, from the testimony of <i>Dioscorides</i>,
and other writers, to have been employed by
the ancient physicians with much confidence and success
as a cathartic; all the parts of the plant were
considered as purgative, although not in an equal degree;
thus <i>Geoffroy</i>, “<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">radicum vis cathartica major
<span class='pageno' id='Page_376'>376</span>est quam foliorum, minor vero quam fructuum</span></i>.” This
question, however, has been very lately set at rest,
by the valuable experiments of <i>Dr. Clutterbuck</i>,<a id='r406' /><a href='#f406' class='c011'><sup>[406]</sup></a>
which prove that the active principle of this plant
resides more particularly in the juice which is lodged
in the centre of the fruit. The forensic physician,
however, will scarcely be liable to meet with a case
of poisoning by the fruit of this plant. It is from that
preparation of the juice, which is admitted into our
Pharmacopœia, under the title of <cite>Extract of Elaterium</cite>,
that we may expect to meet with mischief.</p>

<p class='c000'>This substance subsides spontaneously from the
juice of the fruit; and occurs in commerce in little thin
cakes, or broken pieces, bearing the impression of
the muslin upon which it is dried; its colour is greenish,
its taste bitter, and somewhat acrid; and when
tolerably pure it is light, pulverulent, and inflammable.
Notwithstanding its extreme activity, it
does not, according to our experiments,<a id='r407' /><a href='#f407' class='c011'><sup>[407]</sup></a> contain
more than a tenth part of active matter, which
is a vegetable proximate principle, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">sui generis</span></i>, and
to which we have given the name of <span class='sc'>Elatin</span>. By
treating the Elaterium with alcohol, this principle
may be obtained; it imparts to the spirit a most brilliant,
and beautiful grass green colour—but see our
experiments upon this subject. The action of elaterium
is that of a most violent drastic cathartic, especially
affecting the rectum. It destroys life by its
local action, and consequently finds a place in the
third division of our classification.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_377'>377</span>
  <h4 class='c016'><span class='sc'>Colocynth.</span> <i>Coloquintida</i>; <i>Bitter Apple</i>.</h4>
</div>

<p class='c014'>This is the fruit of the <i>Cucumis Colocynthis</i> (Monœcia
Monodelphia, <i>Nat. Ord.</i> Cucurbitaceæ) an
annual of Turkey and Nubia. It is of the size of an
orange, of a yellowish-white colour, devoid of smell,
round, dry, light, spongy, and smooth on the outside,
when ripe; it is trilocular, each cell containing
many ovate, compressed, whitish seeds, enveloped
by a white spongy pulp. It is imported into this
country, after having been peeled, and dried in a stove.
Its taste is extremely bitter and acrimonious. It acts
upon the human body as a powerfully drastic purgative.
<i>Fordyce</i>,<a id='r408' /><a href='#f408' class='c011'><sup>[408]</sup></a> relates the case of a woman who
was subject to colics for the space of thirty years, in
consequence of having taken an infusion of this fruit
in beer. <i>Tulpius</i><a id='r409' /><a href='#f409' class='c011'><sup>[409]</sup></a> has also furnished us with an
account of the tremendous effects produced by an
overdose of the same article; and <i>Orfila</i> has shewn,
with his usual accuracy, that it acts not only locally
upon the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">primæ viæ</span></i>, but by being absorbed, and carried
into the circulation.</p>

<h4 class='c016'><span class='sc'>Euphorbium.</span> <i>Euphorbia Officinarum</i> (Dodecandria Trigynia. <i>Nat. Ord.</i> Tricoccæ Lin. Euphorbiæ <i>Juss.</i>)</h4>

<p class='c014'>This gum resin is imported from Barbary, in drops,
or irregular tears; its fracture is vitreous; it is inodorous,
but yields a very acrid, burning impression
on the tongue. Its acrid constituent resides exclusively
in that portion which is soluble in alcohol.
This poison has been sometimes administered imprudently
<span class='pageno' id='Page_378'>378</span>as a purgative when it has produced vomiting,
and bloody stools. <i>Lamotte</i> speaks of a clyster prepared
with it, which proved fatal. It acts as a caustic
upon the textures with which it comes in contact, and
thus destroys life by a local action; indeed its nature
is so acrid that when applied to the hair, or to warts,
it causes them to fall off. <i>Scopoli</i> mentions the case
of a person who, having the eye-lids closed, allowed
them to be rubbed with the juice of this plant; in
consequence of which inflammation followed, and
the sight was lost. In pulverizing the gum-resin,
the parmaceutist should take the precaution of previously
moistening it with vinegar, or the powder
will rise, excoriate his face, and excite violent inflammation
of the eyes. There are many species<a id='r410' /><a href='#f410' class='c011'><sup>[410]</sup></a>
of <i>Euphorbium</i>, or <i>spurge</i>, which are highly poisonous;
and, being indigenous, they have frequently proved
the cause of mischief; during the last summer the
author was consulted on the occasion of a family of
children having been seized with a violent inflammation
of the eyes, and eruption on the face, when the
phenomenon was very satisfactorily traced to the
action of the <i>Euphorbia peplus</i>, which was growing
very luxuriantly in the garden where the children
had been playing.</p>

<h4 class='c016'><span class='sc'>Savine.</span><br /> <br /><i>Juniperus Sabina.</i> (Diæcia Monadelphia—<i>Nat. Ord.</i> Coniferæ.)</h4>

<p class='c014'>This shrub is a native of the south of Europe and
the Levant; but has been long cultivated in our gardens.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_379'>379</span>The leaves and tops of the plant have a strong,
heavy, disagreeable odour, and a bitter, hot taste,
with a considerable degree of pungency; qualities
which depend upon the presence of an essential oil.
Upon the animal system it acts as a very powerful
stimulant, and has been received into the list of the
materia medica, as an active emmenagogue; while it
has long enjoyed, amongst the vulgar, the reputation
of being capable of producing abortion.<a id='r411' /><a href='#f411' class='c011'><sup>[411]</sup></a> Upon
this point we have only to observe, that it does not
exert any specific action on the uterus; but as a violent
medicine, acting upon the general system, it
might, in common with other stimulants, produce so
much disturbance as to be followed by abortion. The
experiments of <i>Orfila</i> have shewn that savine exerts
a local action, but that its effects depend principally
on its absorption, through which medium it acts on
the nervous system, the rectum, and the stomach.</p>

<h4 class='c016'><span class='sc'>Aconite.</span> <i>Monkshood.</i><br /> <br /><i>Aconitum Napellus</i> (Polyandria Trigynia—<i>Nat. Ord.</i> Multisiliquæ, <i>Linn.</i> Ranunculaceæ, <i>Juss.</i>)</h4>

<p class='c014'>There are several species of aconite, all of which
are poisonous. The <i>monkshood</i> is a well known plant,
met with in our gardens, and when swallowed in any
quantity will produce the symptoms, characteristic of
vegetable poisons. All the parts of aconite, in the
fresh state, when chewed, produce a sense of heat,
and shortly afterwards a sensation of numbness in the
lips and gums, which does not subside for several
hours.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_380'>380</span>In ancient authors, we frequently meet with <i>aconite</i>
as a poison, but it has been fairly questioned whether
any particular plant was designated by the term<a id='r412' /><a href='#f412' class='c011'><sup>[412]</sup></a>;
like that of <i>cicuta</i>, it seems to have been a word expressive
of poisons generally. The most powerful
form in which this vegetable poison exists is in that
of extract, or inspissated juice<a id='r413' /><a href='#f413' class='c011'><sup>[413]</sup></a>, and, if prepared according
to the improved process of <i>Mr. Barry</i>,<a id='r414' /><a href='#f414' class='c011'><sup>[414]</sup></a> it
will prove highly dangerous in small doses. <i>M. Orfila</i>
relates several fatal accidents from the ingestion of
this plant; his experiments have also shewn that it
will produce its effects by an external application.
We agree, however, with <i>Mr. Brodie</i> in considering
that it acts, without being absorbed, on the brain,
through the medium of the nerves; and we have accordingly
placed it in the first division of our classification.</p>

<p class='c000'>The plants already enumerated are sufficient to
illustrate the symptoms and physiological action of
the acrid poisons of the vegetable kingdom. We
shall, therefore, conclude the history of this class
with some account of the <i>nitrate of potass</i>, which has
been ranked both by <i>Fodéré</i> and <i>Orfila</i> under this division
of their classification.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_381'>381</span>
  <h4 class='c016'><span class='sc'>Nitre.</span> <i>Nitrate of Potass.</i></h4>
</div>

<p class='c014'>The sensible qualities of this salt are too well
known to require any description. It generally occurs
crystallized in six-sided prisms, terminated by
dihedral summits. It is composed of one proportional
of nitric acid, and one proportional of potass. It
dissolves in seven parts of water at 60°, and in its own
weight at 212° <i>Fah.</i> Its solution is attended with a
great reduction of temperature. It is permanent in
the air, melts when exposed to a moderate heat; and,
when cast into moulds, constitutes what is known in
commerce by the name of <i>sal prunelle</i>. When mixed
with inflammable matter it undergoes, in a strong
heat, a rapid species of combustion, which, in chemical
language, is termed <i>deflagration</i>. Concentrated
sulphuric acid, when poured upon this salt in powder,
decomposes it at the ordinary temperature, and
disengages vapours of nitric acid, which are white,
and not very abundant.</p>

<h5 class='c016'><i>Symptoms of poisoning by Nitre.</i></h5>

<p class='c014'>This salt, when taken in a large dose, acts violently
on the stomach and bowels, and occasions
syncope and death. There are several cases recorded
of its having been taken by mistake for <i>Glauber’s salt</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>On these occasions, the patients have been seized
with violent vomiting and purging of blood, attended
with severe pains in the bowels, and a sense of burning
heat, referred to the chest and stomach; cold extremities,
fluttering pulse, laborious breathing, syncope,
and death. The above effects have been produced
by an ounce and a half of nitre; although, as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_382'>382</span><i>Dr. Gordon Smith</i> has observed, the same quantity of
this salt has been inadvertently swallowed <em>without</em> the
production of such tremendous consequences.</p>

<p class='c000'>From the experiments of <i>Orfila</i>, it appears that if
this salt be inserted into a wound, it occasions a fatal
gangrene. Its action is undoubtedly the effect of its
acrid nature, destroying the vitality of the textures
with which it comes in contact. It is not absorbed.</p>

<h5 class='c016'><i>Organic lesions discovered by dissection.</i></h5>

<p class='c014'>In those recorded cases of death from the ingestion
of nitre, the stomach has been found red, scattered
over with blackish spots, and its mucous membrane
disorganized.</p>

<h5 class='c016'><i>Chemical processes for the detection of Nitre.</i></h5>

<p class='c014'>The property which this salt possesses of deflagrating
with combustible bodies, affords a ready indication
of its presence. The process also, which we have
described under the history of nitric acid, (p. <a href='#Page_312'>312</a>) as
the one suggested by <i>Dr. Wollaston</i>, and adopted by
<i>Dr. Marcet</i> in his examination of sea water, furnishes
an elegant mode of ascertaining the presence of a
nitric salt.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>Cl. IV. NARCOTIC POISONS.</h3>

<p class='c014'>These constitute a class of vegetable poisons, less
extensive, perhaps, but of far greater importance and
interest, than the one we have already considered.
It would not be easy to enumerate the various purposes
to which the active imagination of man has applied
the tribe of narcotic plants. Medicines, poisons,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_383'>383</span>intoxication, and madness, lie concealed beneath
their juices. They have, in their turn, arrested the
pangs of disease, and inflicted death upon the unsuspecting
object of hatred and revenge; they have animated
the courage of the warrior, inspired the enthusiasm
of the poet, soothed the sorrows of the wretched,
and furnished the debauchee with a daily source of sensual
gratification; effects which, although apparently
incompatible with each other, may be commanded by
the same substance, in a different dose. It would be
foreign to the plan of this work to enter into a physiological
inquiry into the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">modus operandi</span></i> of these
extraordinary agents; and the author relinquishes
the labour with less regret, as he has already, in
another work,<a id='r415' /><a href='#f415' class='c011'><sup>[415]</sup></a> very fully considered the several
theories which have been advanced for its explanation.</p>

<h4 class='c016'><span class='sc'>Opium</span>, and its <span class='sc'>Preparations</span>.</h4>

<p class='c014'>This well known drug is the inspissated juice of the
<i>Papaver Somniferum</i> (Polyandria Monogynia. <i>Nat.
Ord.</i> Rhoedææ, <i>Linn.</i> Papaveraceæ <i>Juss.</i>) obtained by
making incisions in the half ripe capsules, at sun-set,
when the night dews favour the exudation of the
juice, which is collected in the morning by old women
and children, who scrape it from off the wounds with
a small iron scoop, and deposit the whole in an
earthen pot, where it is worked by wooden spatulas
in the sun-shine, until it attain a considerable degree
of spissitude. It is then formed by the hand into
cakes, which are laid in earthen basins to be further
exsiccated.<a id='r416' /><a href='#f416' class='c011'><sup>[416]</sup></a> Two kinds are found in commerce,
distinguished by the names of <i>Turkey</i>, and <i>East Indian</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_384'>384</span>opium. The latter kind is regarded as being
inferior to the former.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Turkey</i> opium occurs in flat pieces, of a solid compact
texture, possessing considerable tenacity; its
specific gravity is 1·336, so that, when compared with
concrete juices of other plants, it is heavy, being exceeded
only in this respect by opoponax and gum
arabic. It is of a reddish-brown, or fawn-colour,
and has a peculiar, heavy, and narcotic odour; its
taste is acrid, bitter, and hot. By long exposure to
the air, it becomes hard, and breaks with a glimmering
fracture, owing to the presence of a few saline
particles. It is plastic, and when worked with the
fingers is adherent to them. When brought near a
lighted candle it inflames, and burns with a brilliant
light, but its odour at that time is not narcotic. It
is partially soluble in water, alcohol, æther, wine,
vinegar, and lemon-juice. When triturated with hot
water, five parts in twelve are dissolved, six suspended,
and one part remains perfectly insoluble,
and resembles the gluten of wheat, but is of a dark
colour. The alcoholic is more highly charged with
its narcotic principle than the aqueous solution; but
spirit, rather below proof, is its best menstruum.</p>

<p class='c000'>Few vegetable substances have been more frequently,
or more ably submitted to analysis; and
the history of the successive steps by which our knowledge
respecting its composition has advanced, must
encourage us in hoping that we shall shortly be enabled
to identify, by chemical tests, the presence of
opium, with as little difficulty and as great precision
as we are already capable of recognising a metallic
poison.</p>

<p class='c000'>According to the latest chemical views respecting
the composition of this body, it may be stated to consist
<span class='pageno' id='Page_385'>385</span>of the following principles, viz. resin, gum,
bitter extractive, sulphate of lime, gluten, and the
three lately discovered bodies, <i>narcotine</i>, <i>morphia</i>,
and <i>meconic acid</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the year 1803, <i>Derosne</i> first obtained from
opium a crystalline substance, which he found to dissolve
in acids, but he does not appear to have instituted
many experiments, for the elucidation of its
nature and properties. In 1804 <i>Seguin</i> discovered
another crystalline body, and although he described
many of its properties, what appears very extraordinary,
he never even hinted at its alkaline nature.
<i>Sertuerner</i>, at Eimbeck in Hanover, had at the same
time as <i>Derosne</i> and <i>Seguin</i>, obtained these crystalline
bodies, but it was not until the year 1817, that
he first proclaimed the existence of a vegetable alkali,
and attributed to it the narcotic powers which distinguish
the operation of opium; to this body, he gave
the name of <i>Morphia</i>, and it would appear to be the
same as the essential salt of <i>Seguin</i>. The salt of <i>Derosne</i>
was also at first mistaken for the same principle,
but the experiments of <i>Robiquet</i> have pointed
out its distinctive properties, and it has received the
name of <i>Narcotine</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Morphia</i>, upon which the soporific powers of
opium depend, appears to exist in native combination
with a peculiar acid, to which the name of <i>meconic</i>
acid has been bestowed. The following are the
essential characters of this alkaline body, when procured
in a state of purity.<a id='r417' /><a href='#f417' class='c011'><sup>[417]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>It crystallizes in fine, transparent, truncated pyramids,
the bases of which are either squares or rectangles,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_386'>386</span>occasionally united base to base, and thereby
forming octohedra. It is sparingly soluble in boiling
water, but dissolves abundantly in heated alcohol,
giving rise to an intensely bitter solution; in æther
it is far less soluble. It has also the characters of an
alkali; affecting test papers tinged with tumeric or
violets, uniting with acids and forming neutral salts,
and decomposing the compounds of acids with metallic
oxides. It unites with sulphur by means of heat,
but the combination is no sooner formed than it is decomposed.
It fuses at a moderate temperature, when
it resembles melted sulphur, and like that substance
crystallizes on cooling; it is decomposed by distillation,
yielding carbonate of ammonia, oil, and a black
resinous residue, with a peculiar smell; when heated
in contact with air, it inflames rapidly, and like vegetable
matter, it leaves a carbonaceous residue.
When analyzed by means of the deutoxide of copper,
it yields carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, the atomic
proportions of which have not yet been ascertained.
The nitric acid of commerce, when dropped on <i>morphia</i>,
communicates to it a beautiful red colour. <i>Sertuerner</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_387'>387</span>has given us an account of the effect of the
alcoholic solution of <i>morphia</i> on himself, and three
of his pupils; he found that repeated small doses of
half a grain produced at first decided excitation;
then weakness, numbness, and tendency to fainting;
after swallowing vinegar while in this condition, violent
vomiting was excited; in one delicate individual,
profound sleep intervened, and on the following day
he suffered from nausea, vomiting, head-ache, anorexia,
constipation, and heaviness.<a id='r418' /><a href='#f418' class='c011'><sup>[418]</sup></a> This case is
sufficient to shew, that although <i>morphia</i> possesses the
characteristic powers of opium, its strength is by no
means commensurate with its supposed state of concentration.
When uncombined, it exerts little or no
action, in consequence of its insolubility in water,
and in the fluids of the stomach. When, however, it
is combined with an acid, particularly the acetic, or
the <i>meconic</i>, with the latter of which we have before
stated that it exists in opium, it displays its properties
in a very eminent degree. It is also very soluble
in oil; and, according to the experiments of <i>M. Majendie</i>,
the compound acts with great intensity.</p>

<p class='c000'>The <i>meconic acid</i>, when separated from the residuum
of the magnesian salt, as described in the process
for the preparation of morphia (<i>note p.</i> <a href='#Page_386'>386</a>) does
not appear to possess any medicinal activity. Its distinguishing
<em>chemical</em> character is, that it produces an
intensely red colour in solutions of iron, oxidized <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad
maximum</span></i>; and a deep blue, with solutions of the
salts of gold. <i>Narcotine</i> is the salt originally obtained
by <i>Derosne</i>, and is supposed by <i>MM. Majendie</i>
and <i>Robiquet</i> to be the peculiar principle which
produces the excitement experienced by those who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_388'>388</span>take small doses of opium. It may be entirely removed
by macerating the extract of opium in sulphuric
æther.</p>

<h5 class='c016'><i>Symptoms of poisoning by Opium.</i></h5>

<p class='c014'>In considerable doses, the primary action of this
substance, as a powerful and diffusible stimulant, is
not apparent; for the powers of life are immediately
depressed, drowsiness and stupor succeed, and these
are followed by delirium, stertorous breathing, cold
sweats, convulsions, and apoplectic death.</p>

<p class='c000'>The quantity of opium necessary for the production
of such effects must be regarded as <em>relative</em>. In no
two cases can we ensure a similar result, by the administration
of the same dose. But, of all the circumstances
capable of modifying the power of this drug,
habit is the most remarkable; in illustration of which
we have only to adduce the history of the opium
eater, or laudanum drinker; a species of debauchee
by no means uncommon, as every London chemist
can testify, for he frequently experiences considerable
doubt and difficulty in distinguishing persons, to
whom habit has rendered large doses of opium necessary,
from such as purchase it with a view to suicide.<a id='r419' /><a href='#f419' class='c011'><sup>[419]</sup></a>
The lowest fatal dose, to those unaccustomed to
it, seems to be about four grains; but the Turk will
take three drachms in the morning, and repeat the
same dose at night, without any other effects than that
of cheerfulness and exhilaration. This temporary
impunity, however, is dearly purchased by years of
suffering and sorrow. The effects of opium, says
<i>Russel</i>, on those who have been addicted to it, are at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_389'>389</span>first obstinate costiveness, succeeded by diarrhœa and
flatulence, with loss of appetite, and a sottish appearance;
their memories soon fail, they become
prematurely old, and then sink into the grave objects
of scorn and pity.<a id='r420' /><a href='#f420' class='c011'><sup>[420]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Where a person has, from accident, or design,
swallowed a large dose of pure opium, or laudanum,
the symptoms produced are so characteristic and
striking, that the practitioner, who may be summoned
to render assistance, will have no difficulty in
ascertaining their cause.</p>

<p class='c000'>Insensibility, with a scarcely perceptible respiration,
although in some cases it is attended with an
apopletic stertor; the countenance is livid and cadaverous;
the skin cold; and the muscles of the limbs
and trunk in a state of extreme relaxation. The pupils
are insensible to the impression of light, and the
pulse is almost imperceptible. In some stages, the
patient, by being strongly shaken, may be roused for
a few moments from the lethargy; there is generally
a narcotic odour distinguishable in the breath. Vomiting
may also take place upon the first impression
of the laudanum upon the stomach; although after
its action has been displayed upon the brain, it will
be difficult to excite emesis by the most powerful
means; the reason of which may be very satisfactorily
deduced from the ingenious experiments of <i>M. Majendie</i>
on the mechanism of vomiting; by which he
proves, that without the influence of the brain, the
muscles, whose actions constitute an essential part of
the operation, are incapable of performing their duty,
and that vomiting therefore cannot take place. This
is a very important doctrine, inasmuch as it suggests
<span class='pageno' id='Page_390'>390</span>to the pathologist several expedients, by which he
may be enabled to occasion vomiting, by recalling
the excitability of the brain. The period which will
elapse, between the ingestion of the poison, and the
death of the sufferer, may be stated to be from six to
twenty-four hours; but it will in each case be liable
to vary, not only from the quantity of opium swallowed,
but from the habit and peculiar circumstances
of the individual submitted to its operation.</p>

<h5 class='c016'><i>Physiological action of Opium.</i></h5>

<p class='c014'>It is still a question for the decision of future physiologists,
whether the narcotic principle of opium
destroys the functions of the nervous system by a local
impression upon the stomach,<a id='r421' /><a href='#f421' class='c011'><sup>[421]</sup></a> or by being absorbed,<a id='r422' /><a href='#f422' class='c011'><sup>[422]</sup></a>
and brought into contact with the brain in
the course of the circulation. We are inclined to
adopt this latter opinion, and have therefore placed
<i>opium</i> in the second division of our classification; at
the same time, we think that it may occasionally
produce an effect upon the nervous extremities of the
stomach, and we have accordingly placed an <i>asterisk</i>
against the word, by which we denote this double
mode of operation. But, by whatever medium it
may act, it is evident that it occasions death by destroying
the functions of the brain; in consequence
of which the muscles of respiration, no longer supplied
<span class='pageno' id='Page_391'>391</span>with nervous energy, cease to contract, and the
animal dies in a state of suffocation.<a id='r423' /><a href='#f423' class='c011'><sup>[423]</sup></a></p>

<h5 class='c016'><i>Of the treatment in cases of poisoning by Opium.</i></h5>

<p class='c014'>The first object is the evacuation of the stomach by
vomiting; for which purpose, the patient should be
made to swallow from fifteen grains to a scruple of
<i>sulphate of zinc</i>; or, from five to ten grains of <i>sulphate
of copper</i> dissolved in water; and the vomiting
should be kept up for a considerable time, and urged
by irritation of the fauces. Where the act of vomiting
cannot be established, in consequence of the paralysed
state of the nervous system, cold affusion,
applied by means of a shower bath, has been said to
restore the energy of the brain, and thus to render
the patient susceptible of the stimulus of an emetic.<a id='r424' /><a href='#f424' class='c011'><sup>[424]</sup></a>
Venesection has also, under the same circumstances,
been greatly extolled; and, as vascular congestion
in the brain is one of the effects of this poison, it is
reasonable to conclude that, by unloading the vessels
of this organ, we may restore its lost sensibility.
<i>Tissot</i> has strongly recommended the practice,<a id='r425' /><a href='#f425' class='c011'><sup>[425]</sup></a> and
the experiments of <i>Orfila</i> have shewn that it never
aggravated the symptoms of poisoning by opium, nor
accelerated the moment of death; but on the contrary,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_392'>392</span>that in some instances he found that it restored
the animals which would have died, if it had
not been put in practice. Where the operation is
performed, the blood should be drawn from the jugular
vein, in preference to any other. Should these
means prove insufficient to provoke vomiting, <i>M.
Orfila</i> asks, whether one or two grains of <i>tartarized
antimony</i>, dissolved in one or two ounces of water,
might not be injected into the veins? It was formerly
proposed by <i>Boerhaave</i> to empty the stomach
of its poisonous contents, by the introduction of a
syringe; an operation which, it is said, has been
lately performed with success.<a id='r426' /><a href='#f426' class='c011'><sup>[426]</sup></a> Vinegar and vegetable
acids were long considered as <i>antidotes</i> to opium;
but the experiments of <i>M. Orfila</i> have clearly established
that, as long as any portion of the opium
remains in the stomach, these potations, so far from
relieving, aggravate the symptoms of poisoning by
this narcotic, in consequence of the power which
they possess of dissolving it. Where, however, the
opium has been expelled by vomiting, these acid
drinks possess the property of <em>diminishing the consecutive
symptoms</em>, and of thus realising the expectations
which <i>Virgil</i><a id='r427' /><a href='#f427' class='c011'><sup>[427]</sup></a> has so poetically raised,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The powers of the habit should, at the same time,
be supported by brandy, strong coffee, and cordials.
The sufferer should be kept awake; and, if possible,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_393'>393</span>in a continued gentle motion. <i>Dr. Currie</i><a id='r428' /><a href='#f428' class='c011'><sup>[428]</sup></a> has
recommended the affusion of warm water at 106°, or
108°, for removing the stupor.</p>

<p class='c000'>A case is recorded by <i>Dr. Marcet</i>, in the first volume
of the Medico-chirurgical Transactions, where
six ounces of laudanum were taken by a young man,
and remained for five hours in the stomach before
any remedies were applied for its removal; a strong
dose of sulphate of copper, however, provoked vomiting,
and by judicious treatment he eventually
recovered.</p>

<h5 class='c016'><i>Organic lesions discovered on dissection.</i></h5>

<p class='c014'>It has been very truly remarked that although
the instances in which opium has proved fatal to
human life have been very numerous, yet that
the accounts which we have received of the appearances
of the body <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">post mortem</span></i>, are by no means
so satisfactory as we could desire. <i>M. Orfila</i> asserts
that no alteration can be discovered on dissection, in
the digestive canal of persons who have swallowed
any narcotic poison; and that if facts contrary to this
assertion be met with in various authors, it is because
there have been administered irritating substances capable
of producing inflammation.<a id='r429' /><a href='#f429' class='c011'><sup>[429]</sup></a> The lungs,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_394'>394</span>however, frequently exhibit morbid phenomena;
their colour is sometimes violet, and frequently a
deeper red than in the natural state. Their texture
is also more dense, and less crepitating; and they are
marked by livid spots. The blood contained in the
ventricles of the heart, and in the veins, is said to be
found in a liquid state; but <i>Orfila</i> advances a diametrically
opposite opinion, and asserts that it is frequently
coagulated. The brain and its membranes
often exhibit a state of vascular congestion; in the
case recorded by <i>Mr. Stanley</i>, in the sixth volume
of the <cite>Transactions of the College of Physicians</cite>, the
cellular tissue of the pia mater was found to contain
water.<a id='r430' /><a href='#f430' class='c011'><sup>[430]</sup></a></p>

<h5 class='c016'><i>Of the detection of Opium.</i></h5>

<p class='c014'>There is no mode of identifying opium, whether in
a liquid or solid form, so satisfactory as that which
is at once afforded by its powerful and highly characteristic
odour. In fatal instances, we shall always
meet with it in the contents of the alimentary canal,
and in such quantities as will leave no doubt as to its
nature. The chemist may also proceed to a farther
examination, by obtaining <i>morphia</i> from its solution,
by a process which we have already described under
the chemical history of opium.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_395'>395</span>
  <h4 class='c016'><span class='sc'>Black Henbane.</span> <i>Hyoscyamus Niger.</i><br /> <br />(Pentandria Monogynia. <i>Nat. Ord.</i> Luridæ <i>Linn.</i> Solaneæ <i>Juss.</i>)</h4>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Henbane is an indigenous annual, frequent on
waste grounds, and at the sides of roads, particularly
on a calcareous soil, flowering in July. The whole
of the plant is poisonous when eaten; and in the
recent state the odour of the leaves occasions stupor
and delirium. The root of this plant when in full
vegetation is very powerful; and there are several
cases on record, where it has been eaten in mistake
for parsnips,<a id='r431' /><a href='#f431' class='c011'><sup>[431]</sup></a> which it strongly resembles in its
sweet and agreeable flavour. Its operation is very
analogous to that of opium; producing sickness,
stupor, delirium, and coma, with <a id='dil'></a>dilation of the
pupils.</p>

<p class='c000'>The pulse, at first hard, gradually becomes weak
and tremulous; petechiæ frequently make their appearance,
and death ensues. Late experiments have
shewn that a peculiar alkaline body constitutes the
active principle of this plant, and it has accordingly
received, from its discoverers <i>MM. Meissner</i> and
<i>Brandes</i>, the name of <i>Hyoscyama</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Boerhaave</i> experienced a trembling and drunkenness,
in consequence of having prepared a plaister,
into whose composition <i>henbane</i> entered as an ingredient;
and the experiments of <i>M. Orfila</i> have shewn
that it acts nearly in the same manner, whether applied
upon the cellular texture, introduced into the
stomach, or injected into the veins. Hence it follows
that the active principle of this plant is carried into
the circulation, and exerts a remarkable action on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_396'>396</span>the brain and nervous system, producing an extraordinary
state of delirium, which is succeeded by stupefaction.
The physician will never probably be
called upon to investigate a case of wilful poisoning
by this narcotic; and should he be summoned to attend
a person who, through mistake or accident, had
swallowed it, we can hardly anticipate any peculiar
mystery which requires elucidation.</p>

<p class='c000'>There are several other species of henbane, as <i>hyos.
alb. aureus</i>, <i>physaloides</i>, all of which are poisonous,
although not in the same degree as the <i>hyoscyamus
niger</i>, whose history we have just considered.</p>

<h4 class='c016'><span class='sc'>Prussic Acid.</span> <i>Hydro-cyanic Acid.</i></h4>
<h5 class='c016'>The <span class='sc'>Laurel</span> (<i>Prunus lauro-cerasus</i>) and its distilled water. <span class='sc'>Bitter Almonds</span>, and their essential oil.</h5>

<p class='c014'>Hydro-cyanic acid exists in a great variety of native
combinations in the vegetable kingdom, and
imparts to them peculiar qualities, which have been
long known. It is, however, only within a few
years, that this singular body has been obtained in
its separate and independent form<a id='r432' /><a href='#f432' class='c011'><sup>[432]</sup></a>; indeed it was
not until the publication of the celebrated memoir of
<i>Gay-Lussac</i> upon this subject, in the year 1815, that
its chemical composition was fully understood. In
this memoir, it was clearly shewn to consist of a peculiar,
gaseous, and highly inflammable compound
of carbon and nitrogen, to which the name of <i>cyanogene</i>
has been assigned, and hydrogen; the latter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_397'>397</span>body acting as the acidifying principle; whence the
term <i>hydro-cyanic acid</i> is very happily contrived to
express its composition.</p>

<p class='c000'>When obtained in its most concentrated form, by
the process of <i>M. Gay Lussac</i>,<a id='r433' /><a href='#f433' class='c011'><sup>[433]</sup></a> it has the following
characteristic properties, viz. At ordinary temperatures,
it is liquid, colourless, and transparent;
possessing an extremely powerful odour, very analogous
to that of the blossom of the peach, or bitter
almond tree; its taste is, at first, bland and sweetish,
but afterwards pungent, bitter, and peculiar.
Its extreme volatility is such, that when a drop of it
is exposed to the air, on the end of a glass rod, it is
rapidly crystallized. The same phenomenon takes
place, if a drop be suffered to fall on a sheet of paper.
Its specific gravity is ·7055; but, when in a concrete
form it is only ·9, while that of its vapour is ·947.
If inhaled, it produces almost immediate pain in the
head, with deafness, unless very largely diluted with
air or water.<a id='r434' /><a href='#f434' class='c011'><sup>[434]</sup></a> It is decomposed by a high temperature;
and by the action even of light it is, in the
course of a very short time, resolved into carbonic
acid, ammonia, and carburetted hydrogen, a carbonaceous
matter remaining behind.<a id='r435' /><a href='#f435' class='c011'><sup>[435]</sup></a> When brought
near a body in a state of combustion, it instantly
inflames and burns with a blue light. In water it is
sparingly soluble; alcohol dissolves it copiously.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_398'>398</span>The “<i>medicinal Prussic acid</i>,” as it has been called,
as being the preparation lately introduced into medicine,<a id='r436' /><a href='#f436' class='c011'><sup>[436]</sup></a>
differs only from that we have just described,
in its degree of concentration. It is, in fact, the
Prussic acid of <i>Scheele</i>, and may be considered as
equivalent to the preparation of <i>Gay-Lussac</i> diluted
with six times its volume, or eight times and a half
its weight, of distilled water.</p>

<p class='c000'>The <i>hydro-cyanic acid</i> has been discovered, in a
state of perfect formation, in a variety of vegetables,
whose peculiar odour at once announces its presence;
such are bitter almonds; the kernels of apricots,
cherries, particularly the <i>Cerasa Juliana</i>, and
several plums; the leaves of laurel; and peach blossoms;
and the bark of the <i>prunus padus</i>, or bird-cherry
tree. The only mineral substance, in which
hydro-cyanic has yet been detected is the <i>Fer Azuré</i>
of Hauy.<a id='r437' /><a href='#f437' class='c011'><sup>[437]</sup></a> Animal substances, although they do not
contain it ready formed, yet, when treated with an
alkali at a high temperature, they yield it in great
abundance, in consequence of the combination of its
elements.</p>

<h5 class='c016'><i>Action of hydro-cyanic Acid as a Poison.</i></h5>

<p class='c014'>The experiments which have been instituted with
a view to ascertain the exact effects of this substance
upon animal life, very clearly prove that the acid of
<i>Gay-Lussac</i> is one of the most active poisons in nature;
and that the various vegetable bodies, into
whose composition it enters, exert an energy, corresponding
<span class='pageno' id='Page_399'>399</span>with the quantity of this constituent, and
the degree of concentration, in which it exists. The
experiments of <i>M. Orfila</i> were made with Prussic
acid, prepared according to the process of <i>Scheele</i>,
and consequently containing a great proportion of
water, as we have already explained; and yet the
effects which followed its administration were extremely
energetic. From the <cite>Annales de Chimie</cite>, for
October 1814, we learn that a professor of chemistry,
having inadvertently left on his table a phial filled
with a solution of Prussic acid in alcohol, a female
servant, who had been seduced by its agreeable smell,
drank a small glass-full of it, and fell dead at the
end of a few minutes, as if struck by apoplexy.</p>

<p class='c000'>The following case is quoted by <i>Dr. Granville</i>,
from <i>Hufeland</i>. <i>D. L.</i> a robust and healthy man,
aged 36 years, while about to be seized as a thief by
the police officers, snatched a small sealed phial from
his pocket, broke off the neck of it, and swallowed
the greatest part of its contents. A strong smell of
bitter almonds soon spread around, which almost
stupefied all present. The culprit staggered a few
steps; then, without a groan, fell on his knees, and
sunk lifeless down to the ground. Medical assistance
being called in, not the slightest trace of pulse
or breathing could be found. A few minutes afterwards,
a single and violent expiration occurred,
which was again repeated in about two minutes. The
extremities were perfectly cold, the breast and abdomen
still warm, the eyes half open and shining, clear,
lively, full, almost projecting, and as brilliant as
those of the most ardent youth under violent emotion.
The face was neither distorted nor convulsed, but
bore the image of quiet sleep. The corpse exaled a
strong smell of bitter almonds, and the remaining liquid,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_400'>400</span>being analysed, was found to be a concentrated
solution of Prussic acid in alcohol. Cases also stand
recorded where, from imprudent exposure to the vapours
of the Prussic acid, persons have exhibited all
the appearances of being poisoned. Some writers
assert that <i>Scheele</i> himself, who died suddenly, while
engaged in some inquiries into the nature and formation
of this acid, was affected by its deleterious qualities.
<i>Orfila</i> relates that <i>Scharinger</i>, Professor at
Vienna, prepared some pure concentrated Prussic
acid, and having diffused a certain quantity of it
upon his naked arm, he died a short time afterwards.
The professor, however, did not die in consequence
of this accident; it appears, upon inquiry, that he
was seized with apoplexy while sitting in a coffee
house in the evening.</p>

<p class='c000'>The distilled water of the <i>cherry laurel</i><a id='r438' /><a href='#f438' class='c011'><sup>[438]</sup></a> has been
proved, by numerous awful examples, to be a most
energetic poison; and from the fatal effects to which
the officinal preparation of it gave rise, it was early
expunged from the Pharmacopœia of the London
College. In the <cite>Philosophical Transactions</cite> for the
year 1731, we shall find the history of its effects upon
a woman of the name of <i>Boyce</i>, who, with a view to
disprove an allegation, that one <i>Mary Whaley</i> had
died in consequence of drinking a small quantity of
laurel water, swallowed three spoonsful, and, afterwards,
two more of the same liquid; after which she
died in a very short time, without making the least
complaint, and without any convulsion.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Foderé</i> informs us that during the period he was
pursuing his studies at Turin in 1784, the chambermaid
<span class='pageno' id='Page_401'>401</span>and man servant of a noble family of that town,
for the purpose of regaling themselves, stole from
their master a bottle of distilled laurel water; fearful
of being surprised, they hastily swallowed several
mouthsful of it; but they soon paid the price of
their dishonesty, having almost instantly expired in
convulsions. Works on Toxicology also abound
with the relation of experiments, made by numerous
physiologists on different animals, with this deleterious
liquid. Amongst the experimentalists we may
enumerate the names of <i>Madden</i>, <i>Mortimer</i>, <i>Browne</i>,
<i>Langrish</i>, <i>Nicholls</i>, <i>Stenzelius</i>, <i>Heberden</i>, <i>Watson</i>,
<i>Vater</i>, <i>Rattrai</i>, the <i>Abbé Rozier</i>, <i>Duhamel</i>, <i>Fontana</i>,
and <i>Orfila</i>. In this country we have had several
fatal cases of poisoning by laurel water. In the
year 1782, <i>Dr. Price</i>, of Guildford, having professed
to have converted mercury into gold, offered
to repeat his experiments before a competent tribunal,
but the unfortunate philosopher put a period to
his existence before the day appointed for his exhibition,
by a draught of laurel water; a mode of death
which had been, no doubt, suggested by the celebrated
trial of <i>Donellan</i>, for the murder of <i>Sir Theodosius
Boughton</i>, that had taken place in the preceding
year, and left a strong impression upon the public
mind; and whose details, it has been justly observed,
are not more important from the elucidation of the
effects of this poison, than from the strange display
of professional testimony to which it gave origin, (see
<i>Appendix</i>, page 243.) There are those who still
profess to believe that the prisoner was unjustly convicted
upon that occasion; <i>Dr. Male</i> states, without
the least reserve, that it was neither proved that the
deceased was poisoned, nor that any poison had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_402'>402</span>existed.<a id='r439' /><a href='#f439' class='c011'><sup>[439]</sup></a> We feel no difficulty in declaring that
we hold a directly opposite opinion; and we consider
that many of the weaker points of professional evidence
delivered on the trial, have received powerful
support and elucidation from the experiments and observations
of later physicians.</p>

<p class='c000'>Nor are the leaves of this plant wholly free from danger;
it is true that they have, for many years, been in
general use among cooks, to communicate an almond
or kernel-like flavour to custards, puddings, creams,
<i>blanc-mange</i>, and other delicacies of the table; but
the custom has not always been harmless; a fact
with which it behoves the forensic physician to be
acquainted. In some parts of the continent milk is
boiled with one or two leaves of the cherry-laurel in
it, and <i>Ingenhouz</i> states that he saw people much
affected by it. In the <i>Literary Chronicle</i> (no. xxii,
p. 348, 1819) we find the following illustrative case:
“Several children at a boarding-school, in the vicinity
of Richmond, having partaken of some custard
flavoured with the leaves of the cherry-laurel, four of
them were taken severely ill in consequence. Two
of them, a girl of six, and a boy of five years of age,
fell into a profound sleep, out of which they could
not be roused for ten hours, the other two complained
of severe pains in the epigastric region. By proper
medical treatment, they all recovered, after an illness
of three days.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The essential oil of <i>bitter almonds</i> is equally poisonous;
and the water distilled from them is highly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_403'>403</span>dangerous if incautiously taken. <i>Duvignau</i> and <i>Parent</i>
instituted some experiments upon themselves to
ascertain this fact; they commenced by taking six
<a id='dro'></a>drops of the water distilled three times, in an appropriate
vehicle, without producing any other than a
transient impression. On taking <i>eighteen</i> drops, however,
vertigo was experienced, and a disposition to
sleep, accompanied with a tingling of the ears and
dimness of sight. When the dose was increased to
<em>twenty-two</em> drops, alarming symptoms followed, such
as convulsions, and vomiting; which, although the
experimenters succeeded in allaying by antispasmodics,
cured them completely of any ulterior wish
to ascertain how far this substance might be deleterious.
A drachm of the distilled water of bitter almonds
has killed a moderate sized dog. The <i>essential oil</i> is
proportionally more active; <i>Mr. Brodie</i><a id='r440' /><a href='#f440' class='c011'><sup>[440]</sup></a> found
that one drop, when applied to the tongue of a cat,
killed it in five minutes; no sooner did the poison
come in contact with the organ than the animal was
seized with convulsions. When two drops of the
same oil were injected with half an ounce of water
into the rectum of a cat, it was not seized for two
minutes, but it died, as in the former experiment,
after the expiration of five minutes. While engaged
in this inquiry, <i>Mr. Brodie</i> dipped the blunt end of a
probe into the essential oil, and applied it to his
tongue, with the intention of tasting it, and not having
the least suspicion that so small a quantity could
produce any of its specific effects on the nervous system;
but scarcely had he applied it, when he experienced
a very remarkable and unpleasant sensation,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_404'>404</span>which he referred chiefly to the epigastric region, but
the exact nature of which he could not describe, because
he knew nothing similar to it. At the same
time there was a sense of weakness in his limbs, as if
he had not the command of his muscles; and he
thought that he should have fallen. The fascinating
liqueur noyau, <i>créme de noyau</i>, is indebted for its
flavour to the essential oil of the bitter almond, or
peach; and is undoubtedly deleterious if taken in
excess. In the <cite>Journal des Debats</cite>, for 1814, we
find that the late <i>Duke Charles de Lorraine</i> had
nearly lost his life from swallowing some drops of
<i>eau de noyau</i> too strongly impregnated with the essential
oil of peach kernels.</p>

<p class='c000'>The bitter almond itself, in consequence of the
manner in which its deleterious principle is modified
by the natural state of combination in which it exists
with sweet oil and albumen, does not produce an
effect corresponding with the proportion of essential
oil which it yields. The experiments of <i>Orfila</i>, however,
prove that the almond, in doses of a drachm,
is destructive to cats; and there can be no doubt but
that it would be equally deleterious to the human
species; but the quantity required for the production
of such an effect must ever prevent the bitter almond
from becoming either the accidental or criminal instrument
of death.</p>

<h5 class='c016'><i>Physiological action of Prussic acid.</i></h5>

<p class='c014'>The numerous experiments, which have been made
with this poison, have clearly established that its action
is upon the nervous system, whose energies it
would seem to extinguish without any ostensible injury
to respiration and circulation; for in all those
<span class='pageno' id='Page_405'>405</span>animals which were killed by it, in the experiments
of <i>Orfila</i>, <i>Brodie</i>, and others, the heart was found
acting regularly, and circulating dark coloured
blood, and in some cases this phenomenon was visible
for many minutes after the animal was in other respects
apparently dead. <i>Orfila</i> considers that he has
fully demonstrated that these effects depend on the
absorption of the poison, and its transmission to the
brain through the medium of the circulation. We
have accordingly placed Prussic acid in the second
division of our classification. The essential oil of
bitter almonds would, according to the experiments
of <i>Mr. Brodie</i>, appear to act through the medium of
the nerves, and it has accordingly been referred to
our first division. This is undoubtedly an anomaly,
which it is not easy to reconcile; the experiments,
however, which led <i>Mr. Brodie</i> to the conclusion appear
to us to warrant such a deduction; the instantaneousness
with which the poisonous effects were produced,
and the fact of its acting more speedily when
applied to the tongue, than when injected into the
intestines, although the latter presents a better absorbing
surface, seem to oppose the idea of the oil
requiring to be absorbed, before it can display its
energies. <i>M. Vogel</i>, of Munich, has lately discovered
some facts respecting the composition of this
oil, which may perhaps hereafter lead to the true
explanation of this apparent anomaly; this distinguished
chemist succeeded in separating the Prussic
acid from the volatile oil with which it is combined,
by agitating the whole in a concentrated solution of
potass, and distilling to dryness; the oil volatilized
together with the water, while the residuum in the
retort was found to contain <i>cyanide of potassium</i>.
The oil, thus separated from the Prussic acid, is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_406'>406</span>without odour, and heavier than water; its taste is
extremely acrid and burning; in order to discover
whether it was still poisonous, <i>M. Vogel</i> put a drop
of it on the tongue of a sparrow, when it died in a
few seconds, after a very violent convulsion; he also
poisoned a dog, two months old, with four drops of
it; whence he concludes that the volatile oil, divested
of its hydro-cyanic acid is still a poison,
although less energetic than that which has not
undergone such a change. Do there exist then two
independent principles of activity in the <i>bitter almond</i>?
If such a fact were established it would not
be solitary, for we shall hereafter shew that the energies
of <i>tobacco</i> are dependant upon an analogous
arrangement; and that our ignorance of the fact, at
first, occasioned apparent anomalies, as embarrassing
as those which at present involve the physiological
history of the oil of almonds.</p>

<h5 class='c016'><i>Antidotes.</i></h5>

<p class='c014'><i>Orfila</i>, in his celebrated Toxicology, informs us that
vinegar, or the vegetable acids; coffee; a solution of
chlorine in water; camphor; emollient drinks; and
bleeding, have been successively, but not <a id='suc'></a>successfully
recommended.<a id='r441' /><a href='#f441' class='c011'><sup>[441]</sup></a> With respect to the first of these
pretended <i>antidotes</i>, it deserves notice, that instead
of palliating the symptoms, it actually quickens, and
gives more energy to the action of the poison. Coffee,
as far as it may stimulate, might be employed with
advantage; but its powers are not sufficient to meet
the exigency of the case. Bleeding seems decidedly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_407'>407</span>a fatal measure. The authors of the paper on Prussic
acid, inserted in the <i>American Recorder</i>, consider at
length the claims of every substance which has been
proposed as an antidote to it; and they conclude by
saying that, we are entirely ignorant of a counter-agent
of this poison. There is every reason, says
<i>Dr. Granville</i>, to believe that the Prussic acid taken
in large quantities, and in its concentrated state, is
partially, if not wholly absorbed ere it <em>reaches the
stomach</em>;—else how happens it that scarcely a minute
after its exhibition, I have, in common with others,
been unable to detect its presence within that organ.
If so, then all chemical attempts must be nugatory,
no decomposition, or fresh combinations can be produced
to render it harmless; nor will an emetic, although
so much recommended, be of much more service
in freeing the system of its presence. But
although chemical remedies are thus shewn to be of
no avail, we may derive from the class of vital agents
some powerful antidotes; all medicines taken from
the class of diffusible stimuli will be useful in supporting
the powers of the system against the sedative
influence of the poison. Hot brandy and water, with
ammonia, camphor, and other similar stimulants,
are the resources to which we should fly upon such
occasions.</p>

<h5 class='c016'><i>Organic lesions discovered on Dissection.</i></h5>

<p class='c014'>The recorded dissections of persons, who have
been poisoned by Prussic acid, are too few and vague
to furnish any satisfactory generalization. In the
case related by <i>M. Foderé</i>, of two servants who died
after a draught of laurel-water, the dead bodies were
carried to the University at Turin, and examined,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_408'>408</span>when the stomach was found slightly inflamed, but
the other parts were in a sound state. We feel much
hesitation in giving credit to this report, the death
was too immediate to allow the access of inflammation;
we are rather disposed to consider the appearances
of the stomach to have arisen from that species
of sanguineous congestion, which we have before
alluded to, as sometimes occurring in cases of sudden
death. In other cases the coats of the stomach are
said to have been black and relaxed; the vessels of
the brain injected; the lungs have also been described
as presenting unnatural congestions, and purple
spots; and the smell of Prussic acid seemed as if it
pervaded the whole system, and was embodied, as it
were, with the very substance of the muscles. In
other cases, again, not the slightest trace of any morbid
appearance could be discovered. Some authors
have stated that in cases of death by this poison the
cornea of the eye does not collapse, but retains its fulness,
and even its lustre, for a considerable period.</p>

<h5 class='c016'><i>Chemical processes by which the presence of hydro-cyanic acid may be ascertained.</i></h5>

<p class='c014'>The strong odour yielded by the body on dissection,
will furnish a satisfactory proof of the presence
of this poison. Instances may occur, when the practitioner
will be called before a tribunal to answer,
from his professional knowledge, whether a particular
case of death can have happened from the action of
the hydro-cyanic acid, or any of the compounds in
which it may enter as an ingredient; it therefore becomes
an object of great importance to inquire
whether any farther tests might be made subservient
to our purpose. <i>Dr. Granville</i>, who has directed a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_409'>409</span>great share of his attention to the history of this poison,
has given some directions upon this point, which
appear to us to be useful and judicious; we shall,
therefore, present them to our readers. “After collecting
the blood contained in the ventricles of the
heart, a portion of the contents of the stomach, and
of the superior intestines, together with a certain
quantity of any fluid which may chance to be present
within the cavity of the head, chest, or abdomen;
and having agitated the mixture for some time in distilled
water, and filtered the liquid, taking care to
keep the whole at a low temperature, proceed to the
following experiments.</p>

<p class='c015'>A. To a small quantity of the liquid add a few
drops of a solution of caustic potass in alcohol.</p>
<p class='c015'>B. To this, a few drops of a solution of sulphate
of iron must be added, when a cloudy and reddish
precipitate, of the colour of burnt <i>Terra-Sienna</i>
will fall down.</p>
<p class='c015'>C. Some sulphuric acid is now to be introduced
into the tube, when the colour of the precipitate
will instantly change to that of a bluish-green,
which by a permanent contact with the
atmosphere, becomes gradually of a beautiful
blue, assuming at the same time a pulverulent
aspect.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c021'>
    <div>OR</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>A. Treat the filtered liquid with carbonate of
potass.</p>
<p class='c015'>B. Add a solution of sulphate of iron with a
small quantity of alum: a precipitate, as in
the former method, will fall down, which if
treated by free sulphuric acid, will also become
<span class='pageno' id='Page_410'>410</span>blue and pulverulent. During this latter
part of the experiment, there is a disengagement
of carbonic acid.</p>

<p class='c000'>Evidence may be pushed still farther, and the
existence of the Prussic acid proved in a most positive
manner by decomposing the precipitate, above
described, and which is a true Prussian blue, so as
to separate the acid. For this purpose, heat the
precipitate with an equal quantity of tartaric acid, in
a glass retort, at the temperature of 150°, when the
hydro-cyanic vapours will soon exhale from the mixture,
and may be received in water.”<a id='r442' /><a href='#f442' class='c011'><sup>[442]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c013'>Cl. V. NARCOTICO-ACRID POISONS.</h3>

<p class='c014'>This plant is an indigenous perennial, found in
many parts of Great Britain, particularly in shady
places where the soil is calcareous, in large ditches,
and on the edge of hilly woods; flowering in June,
and ripening its berries in September. Every part
of the plant is poisonous; and numerous instances
have occurred where children, and the ignorant, or
those suffering from hunger, allured by the beautiful
and tempting appearance of the berries, have fallen
victims to their deadly power. The root of this plant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_411'>411</span>partakes also of the same qualities as the leaves and
berries, but is perhaps less virulent.</p>

      <div class='line'>That takes the reasoner prisoner.”—<i>Macbeth.</i></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The inspissated juice (<i>Extractum Belladonnæ
Pharm. Lond.</i>) is also extremely poisonous, when
properly prepared; but, as usually met with in
commerce, it is of very variable strength; when prepared
according to the improved process of <i>Mr.
Barry</i>, its activity is so considerable that a dose of
two grains is followed by unpleasant effects. (<i>See an
account of its effects in the Pharmacologia</i>, <i>vol.</i> 2, <i>p.</i>
199.) <i>M. Brandes</i> has lately ascertained that the
active principle of this plant is a peculiar alkaline
body, to which he has assigned the name of <i>atropia</i>.</p>

<h5 class='c016'><i>Symptoms of poisoning by Belladonna.</i></h5>

<p class='c014'>Shortly after the ingestion of the berries, leaves,
or root, of this plant, the patient complains of extreme
dryness of the lips, tongue, palate, and throat;
the deglutition becomes difficult, and the pupil of the
eye immoveably dilated; nausea, rarely followed by
vomiting; symptoms of intoxication succeed, accompanied
with fits of laughter, dreadful ravings, violent
gestures of the body, and continual motion of the
hands and fingers; sometimes the patient sinks into a
state of fatuity, but rarely of stupor; redness and
tumefaction of the face, a low and feeble pulse, paralysis
of the intestines, livid spots on different parts
of the body, profuse sweats, convulsions, and death.
In the cases where recovery has taken place, there
has been an insensible restoration to health and
reason, without any recollection of the preceding
state.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_412'>412</span>
  <h5 class='c016'><i>Physiological action of Belladonna.</i></h5>
</div>

<p class='c014'>The results of the experiments of <i>Orfila</i> authorise
us to arrange the nightshade under the second division
of our classification; for it is evidently absorbed,
carried into the circulation, and is thus enabled to act
upon the nervous system, and particularly on the brain.
At the same time it exerts a local action upon the
stomach, although less violent than that occasioned
by the acrid poisons. It, moreover, appears on
some occasions to act directly through the medium of
the nerves, like those substances which constitute
our first class; or else how shall we explain the fact
of the pupil of the eye becoming permanently dilated,
by the contact of the belladonna with the tunica conjunctiva?
It would, therefore, appear that this plant
unites within itself all the three great modes of action,
upon which we have attempted to found our physiological
arrangement of poisons, as expressed by the
tabular classification at page <a href='#Page_207'>207</a>.</p>

<h5 class='c016'><i>Organic lesions discovered on dissection.</i></h5>

<p class='c014'>The bodies of those who have perished by belladonna,
are extremely prone to decomposition; they
soon putrefy, swell remarkably, and are covered
with livid spots; blood flows from the mouth, nose,
and eyes, and the stench is insufferable. The stomach
and intestines will sometimes display extensive
marks of inflammation, extending in some cases to
the mesentery and liver; and several cases are recorded
in which the stomach appeared ulcerated. The
lungs are usually found livid, gorged with venous
blood, and studded with black spots; the heart has
been also observed to be livid.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_413'>413</span>
  <h5 class='c016'><i>Modes of detecting the presence of Belladonna.</i></h5>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Where the berries of this plant have been swallowed,
we shall generally detect them in the matter
vomited; or, in the event of death, in the stomach,
on dissection, for they would appear to be very indigestible;
in a case of poisoning by this plant, recorded
in the history of the French Academy for the year
1706,<a id='r443' /><a href='#f443' class='c011'><sup>[443]</sup></a> the stomach was found to contain some berries
of the belladonna crushed, and some seeds.
Where the quantity of the plant is sufficient, we may
proceed to identify it, by obtaining <i>atrophia</i><a id='r444' /><a href='#f444' class='c011'><sup>[444]</sup></a> from
it. For this purpose, the leaves, or the crushed
berries, or any other part of the suspected plant,
must be boiled in distilled water; the decoction must
then be pressed out, and filtered; after the albumen
has been thrown down by a little sulphuric acid, potass
must be added as long as any precipitate is produced;
when the precipitate is to be washed in pure water,
re-dissolved in muriatic acid, and re-precipitated by
ammonia. This last result will be <i>atropia</i>. It is
white, and collects in acicular crystals, insipid, little
soluble in cold water, or even in alcohol, but very
soluble in this latter fluid at a boiling temperature,
from which, however, it is deposited on cooling.</p>

<h4 class='c016'><span class='sc'>Stramonium.</span> <i>Thorn-Apple.</i> <i>James-town Weed.</i><br /> <br /><i>Datura Stramonium</i> (Pentandria Monogynia. <i>Nat. Ord.</i> Solanaceæ, <i>Linn.</i> Solaneæ, <i>Juss.</i>)</h4>

<p class='c014'>The thorn apple is an annual plant, a native of
America, which gradually diffused itself, from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_414'>414</span>south to the north, and is now naturalized to this
country, and is to be found very commonly about
London growing on dunghills, and by road sides. It
flowers in July and August. Every part of this plant
is a strong narcotic poison, producing vertigo, and
most of those <a id='sym'></a>symptoms which we have described as
the effects of belladonna, although the former plant
appears to excite the brain more violently. <i>Dr. Barton</i>
mentions the case of two British soldiers, who ate
it by mistake, for the <i>chenopodium album</i>; one became
furious, and ran about like a madman; and the
other died, with the symptoms of genuine tetanus.
In the fifth volume of the <cite>Edinburgh Medical and
Philosophical Commentaries</cite>, two cases are related by
<i>Dr. Fowler</i>; and others are to be found in the writings
of <i>Haller</i>, <i>Krause</i>, <i>Sproegel</i>, <i>Gmelin</i>, and <i>Orfila</i>,
illustrative of the effects of this plant upon the
human species. There is reason to believe that this
plant has been long known, and that it has been very
generally used by uncivilized nations, on account of
the narcotic effects which it occasions.</p>

<h4 class='c016'><span class='sc'>Tobacco.</span> <i>Nicotiana Tabacum.</i><br /> <br />(Pentandria Monogynia. <i>Nat. Ord.</i> Luridæ, <i>Lin.</i> Solaneæ, <i>Juss.</i>)</h4>

<p class='c014'>Tobacco is an annual plant, a native of America,
from whence it was imported into Europe. We learn
from <i>Humboldt</i> that it has been cultivated from time
immemorial by the native people of the Oroonoko;
and was smoked all over America at the time of the
Spanish conquest. <i>Hermandez de Toledo</i> sent it into
Spain and Portugal in 1559, when <i>Jean Nicot</i><a id='r445' /><a href='#f445' class='c011'><sup>[445]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_415'>415</span>was Ambassador at the court of Lisbon, from Francis
II, and he transmitted, or carried either the seed, or
the plant to <i>Catherine de Medicis</i>, as one of the wonders
of the new world, and which, it was supposed,
possessed virtues of a very extraordinary nature.
This seems to be the first authentic record of the
introduction of this plant into Europe. In 1589 the
Cardinal <i>Santa Croce</i>, returning from his nunciature
in Spain and Portugal to Italy, carried thither with
him tobacco; and we may form some notion of the
enthusiasm with which its introduction was hailed,
from a perusal of the poetry which the subject inspired.
It is said that the smoking tobacco was first
introduced by <i>Sir Walter Raleigh</i> on his return from
America; and the avidity with which the custom was
immediately adopted is shewn by the philippic written
against it by King James, entitled the “<cite>Counterblaste
to Tobacco</cite>.”</p>

<p class='c000'>As an object of Medical Jurisprudence, its claims
to our attention are numerous and important; not
only as having occasionally been the means of destroying
human life, but as furnishing, in its most
romantic history, a striking illustration of the triumph
of popular opinion over a series of legislative enactments<a id='r446' /><a href='#f446' class='c011'><sup>[446]</sup></a>
which had no other origin than that of ignorance
and prejudice.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_416'>416</span>Tobacco was at one period of our history raised to
a considerable extent in Yorkshire; but the cultivation
of it for the purposes of trade have been long
prohibited; and this country, as well as the greater
part of Europe, is chiefly supplied from Virginia,
where the plant is cultivated in the greatest abundance.
The recent leaves do not possess any considerable
odour, nor have they much flavour; when
dried, however, their odour becomes strong, narcotic,
and somewhat fœtid; their taste bitter, and extremely
acrid. We have stated, upon another occasion,<a id='r447' /><a href='#f447' class='c011'><sup>[447]</sup></a>
that tobacco would appear to contain two independent
elements of activity, an essential oil, and a
proximate principle, of an acrid nature, to which
<i>Vauquelin</i> has bestowed the name of <i>Nicotin</i>. The
essential oil is an extremely virulent poison. <i>Mr.
Barrow</i>, speaking of the use which the Hottentots
make of it for destroying snakes, says, “A Hottentot
applied some of it from the short end of his wooden
tobacco-pipe to the mouth of a snake, while darting
out his tongue. The effect was as instantaneous as
an electric shock; with a convulsive motion that was
momentary, the snake half untwisted itself, and never
stirred more; and the muscles were so contracted,
that the whole animal felt hard and rigid, as if dried
in the sun.” The author has ventured a conjecture in
his <cite>Pharmacologia</cite>,<a id='r448' /><a href='#f448' class='c011'><sup>[448]</sup></a> with respect to this virulent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_417'>417</span>oil, which he takes this opportunity of repeating, that
“<i>the juice of cursed hebenon</i>,” by which, according to
<i>Shakspeare</i>, the King of Denmark was poisoned, was
no other than the essential oil of tobacco.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in6'>----“Sleeping within mine orchard,</div>
      <div class='line'>My custom always of the afternoon,</div>
      <div class='line'>Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole,</div>
      <div class='line'>With juice of <em>cursed hebenon</em> in a vial,</div>

      <div class='line'>The leperous <em>distilment</em>.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>In the first place, the learned commentator <i>Dr.
Gray</i> observes, that the word here used (<i>hebenon</i>) was
more probably designated by a <i>metathesis</i>, either of
the poet or transcriber, for <i>henebon</i>, i. e. henbane.
Now it appears from <i>Gerarde</i> that <i>tabaco</i> was commonly
called “<i>henbane of Peru</i>” (Hyoscyamus Peruvianus);
and when we consider how high the prejudice
of the court ran against this herb, as so strikingly
evinced by the ‘<i>Counterblaste</i>’ of King James, it seems
very likely that <i>Shakspeare</i>, who was fond of playing
the courtier, should have selected it, as an agent of
extraordinary malignity, upon such an occasion. No
preparation of the <i>hyoscyamus</i> with which we are
acquainted, would produce death by an application
to the ear; whereas the essential oil of tobacco might,
without doubt, occasion a fatal result. The term
<i>distilment</i> has also called forth a remark from <i>Steevens</i>,
which is calculated to add a little farther weight<a id='r449' /><a href='#f449' class='c011'><sup>[449]</sup></a>
to our conjecture; “surely” says he, “this expression
signifies, that the preparation was the result of
a <i>distillation</i>.”</p>

  <h5 class='c016'><i>Symptoms of poisoning by Tobacco.</i></h5>
</div>

<p class='c014'>The leaves of tobacco, whether whole, or reduced
to powder, as they are daily met with in commerce,
or in the form of infusion in water or wine, or in the
state of smoke, are endued with poisonous properties
of extreme energy. Their administration is shortly
followed by vertigo; severe nausea; vomiting; a general
tremor of the body, which is rarely the result
of any other poison; cold sweats; syncope; and
death. The author remembers witnessing a lamentable
exemplification of the action of tobacco upon a
person labouring under a strangulated hernia. The
patient had been under the care of a medical practitioner
in the vicinity of London, who after repeated
and fruitless efforts to return the intestine, injected
an infusion of tobacco into the rectum, and sent him
in a carriage to the Westminster hospital, for the
purpose of undergoing the operation; but the unfortunate
man expired very shortly after his arrival, in
consequence of the effects of the tobacco clyster.
The external application of tobacco, in the form of
cataplasm, or infusion, will occasion all the effects
above related. A woman applied to the heads of
three children afflicted with <i>tinea capitis</i>, a liniment
consisting of powdered tobacco and butter, soon after
which they experienced vertigo, violent vomiting,
and fainting.<a id='r450' /><a href='#f450' class='c011'><sup>[450]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>It was formerly a practice to inject the smoke of
tobacco into the anus, by means of a bellows of a peculiar
construction, in cases of suspended animation,
with a view to <i>stimulate</i> the rectum, and thereby to
revive the vital powers; we have already commented
<span class='pageno' id='Page_419'>419</span>upon this most dangerous and mistaken notion, (<i>see
page</i> <a href='#Page_88'>88</a>.)</p>

<p class='c000'>In the process of <em>smoking</em> tobacco, the oil is separated,
and being rendered empyreumatic by heat, it
is thus applied to the fauces in its most active form;
whence vertigo, nausea, and all its characteristic
symptoms speedily arise upon that occasion; although
the system becomes easily habituated to the action of
this narcotic, and we continually see a large portion
of the community using it daily, in various ways, and
in great quantities, as a luxury, without experiencing
any other bad effect than that which arises from their
inability to relinquish the habit.</p>

<p class='c000'>The well known errhine, <i>snuff</i>, is prepared from
the dried leaves of tobacco, and possesses all the
powers of the plant. The celebrated <i>Santeuil</i> experienced

expired, in consequence of having drank a glass of
wine, into which some Spanish snuff had been introduced.<a id='r451' /><a href='#f451' class='c011'><sup>[451]</sup></a></p>

<h5 class='c016'><i>Physiological action of Tobacco.</i></h5>

<p class='c014'>The deleterious effects of this plant appear to depend
on an especial action upon the nervous system;
but farther experiments are required to establish
through what medium its powers are conveyed to the
sensorium. <i>Orfila</i> concludes that the active part of
the plant is absorbed, and carried into the circulation.
<i>Mr. Brodie’s</i> experiments, however, would lead to
the conclusion that it operates through the medium
of the nerves; and, what is extremely singular, they
shew that the <i>essential oil</i> operates very differently
<span class='pageno' id='Page_420'>420</span>from the <i>infusion</i> of tobacco; for that while the former
appears to act exclusively on the brain, leaving
the power of the circulation unimpaired, the latter
acts on the heart at once, suspending its action even
before the animal ceases to respire, and kills by producing
syncope. This apparent anomaly at first led
<i>Mr. Brodie</i>, as he has since informed the author, to
suspect the accuracy of his experiments; but their
careful repetition rendered this impossible. We suggested
to him, whether a probable explanation might
not be found in the late chemical results respecting
the composition of tobacco, which seemed to shew
that this plant possesses two active elements.<a id='r452' /><a href='#f452' class='c011'><sup>[452]</sup></a></p>

<h4 class='c016'><span class='sc'>Hemlock.</span> <i>Cicuta.</i><a id='r453' /><a href='#f453' class='c011'><sup>[453]</sup></a><br /> <br /><i>Conium<a id='r454' /><a href='#f454' class='c011'><sup>[454]</sup></a> Maculatum</i> (Pentandria Digynia. <i>Nat. Ord.</i> Umbellatæ.)</h4>

<p class='c014'>Hemlock is a biennial, umbelliferous, indigenous
plant, growing very commonly about the sides of
fields, under hedges, and in moist shady places. It
is at once distinguished from other umbelliferous
plants, with which it may be confounded, by its <em>large</em>
and <em>spotted</em> stem, the dark and <em>shining colour of its
lower leaves</em>, and their <em>disagreeable smell</em>; which,
when fresh and bruised is said to bear a strong resemblance
to that of the urine of a cat. Many<a id='r455' /><a href='#f455' class='c011'><sup>[455]</sup></a> cases of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_421'>421</span>persons who have been poisoned by this plant are to
be found in the writings of different toxicologists.
The extract, if properly prepared, is a very energetic
substance, and gives rise, in large doses, to all
the symptoms which we have so often described as
the result of narcotic poisons. In those fatal cases,
where the bodies have been examined, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">post mortem</span></i>,
inflammation of the stomach, and sanguineous congestion
in the brain, have been the most prominent phenomena.
It would appear that the active element of
this plant is absorbed and carried into the circulation,
through which medium it exerts its action on the nervous
system, and more particularly on the brain. At
the same time it seems to excite a local irritation, capable
of producing an inflammation more or less violent.
The best antidote is vinegar, after the stomach
has been evacuated, and the cerebral excitement reduced
by bleeding and purging.</p>

<p class='c000'>The <i>Cicuta Virosa</i>, or <i>water hemlock</i>, with which
the <i>conium maculatum</i> has been often confounded, is
still more virulent; it is however to be distinguished
from the latter, by having its hollow roots always
immersed in water, while those of the <i>conium</i> never
are. <i>M. Orfila</i> has related several cases of poisoning
by the <i>water hemlock</i>.</p>

<h4 class='c016'><span class='sc'>Nux Vomica.</span><br /> <br />This is the seed of the <i>Strychnus Nux Vomica</i> (Pentandria Monogynia, <i>Nat. Ord.</i> Apocyneæ, <i>Juss.</i>)</h4>

<p class='c014'>The tree<a id='r456' /><a href='#f456' class='c011'><sup>[456]</sup></a> which produces these seeds grows in
Ceylon, upon the coast of Coromandel, and in Malabar.
The nux vomica is round and flat, about an
inch broad, and nearly a quarter of an inch thick,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_422'>422</span>with a prominence in the middle on both sides, of a
grey colour, covered with a kind of woolly matter,
but internally hard and tough. The kernel discovers
to the taste a considerable bitterness, but makes little
or no impression on the organs of smell. There is a
popular belief that this substance is poisonous to all
animals, except man. Instances, however, are not
wanting to illustrate its deleterious effects upon the
human species. It proves fatal to dogs in a very
short period; it has also poisoned hares, foxes,
wolves, cats, rabbits, and even some birds. <i>Loureiro</i>
relates that a horse died in four hours after taking
a drachm of the seed in an half roasted state. Its
effects, however, on different animals, and even on
those of the same species, are somewhat uncertain,
and not always in the proportion to the quantity
given. With some animals it produces its effects
almost instantaneously: with others, not until after
the lapse of several hours, when laborious respiration,
followed by torpor, tremblings, coma, and convulsions
usually precede the fatal spasms, or <i>Tetanus</i>,
which so especially distinguishes the operation of this
poison. <i>Hoffman</i> reports the case of a young girl of
ten years of age, who, labouring under an obstinate
quartan fever, took, at two doses, fifteen grains of
nux vomica, and died very shortly afterwards. <i>MM.
Pelletier</i> and <i>Caventou</i> have discovered in these
seeds, a peculiar proximate principle, to which their
virulence is owing; it was originally named <i>Vauqueline</i>,
in honour of the celebrated French philosopher,
but in deference to the opinion of the French Academy
of Sciences, the discoverers have substituted
the name <i>Strychnia</i>,<a id='r457' /><a href='#f457' class='c011'><sup>[457]</sup></a> because “a name dearly
loved, ought not to be applied to a noxious principle!”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_423'>423</span><i>Strychnia</i> is highly alkaline, and crystallizes in
very small four-sided prisms, terminated by four-sided
pyramids; its taste is insupportably bitter,
leaving a slight metallic flavour, and is so powerful
as even to be perceptible when a grain is dissolved in
eighty pounds of water;<a id='r458' /><a href='#f458' class='c011'><sup>[458]</sup></a> it has no smell. So extreme
is its activity upon the animal system, that in
doses of half a grain it occasions serious effects, and
in larger ones, convulsions and death. It is, perhaps,
the most powerful, and, next to <i>hydro-cyanic
acid</i>, the most rapid of poisons. <i>M. Majendie</i> has
killed a dog with one-eighth of a grain; and the
editor of the <cite>Edinburgh Medical and Surgical Journal</cite>
has seen one die in two minutes after the injection
of one-sixth of a grain into the cavity of the
pleura.</p>

<p class='c000'>Nux vomica is supposed by <i>Orfila</i> to exert a specific
action on the spinal marrow, thereby producing
tetanus, immobility of the thorax, and consequently
asphyxia, of which the animal dies. That this effect
is produced by the absorption of the poison, and its
passage into the circulation, is clearly established by
the interesting and important experiments of <i>M.
Majendie</i>.<a id='r459' /><a href='#f459' class='c011'><sup>[459]</sup></a></p>

<h4 class='c016'><span class='sc'>Cocculus Indicus.</span></h4>

<p class='c014'>This is the fruit of a shrub (<i>Menispermum Cocculus</i>)
which grows naturally in the sand, in the midst
of the rocks, on the coast of Malabar, in the island
of Ceylon, and in other parts of the East Indies.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_424'>424</span>The berries are imported into this country in a dry
and shrivelled state. In India they are employed
for killing fish, which they intoxicate and poison,
when thrown into fish ponds. <i>M. Goupil</i>,
a physician of Nemours, communicated to the Society
of Medicine some interesting facts on the subject
of this poison;<a id='r460' /><a href='#f460' class='c011'><sup>[460]</sup></a> and he has shewn that it is
not only destructive to fishes, but also to different
carnivorous quadrupeds, and, very probably, to man.
He also states that the poisonous principle of this
substance is not sensibly changed by the gastric
juices, and the vital action of the organs of digestion;
but, on the contrary, that it passes into the
absorbent system with all its properties unimpaired;
and that the flesh of those fishes which have eaten it,
irritates the stomach and bowels of the animals to
which it is given, nearly in the same manner as the
<i>Cocculus Indicus</i> itself. All the fishes who eat it do
not die in an equal space of time. <i>Roach</i>, <i>pollard</i>,
<i>breme</i>, <i>perch</i>, <i>tench</i>, and <i>barbel</i>, are affected in an order
corresponding with that in which they are here arranged;
the <i>roach</i> is killed the easiest of all; the
<i>barbel</i> is the last to die, and is moreover said to be,
of all fish, the one whose flesh the most frequently
occasions accidents in those animals who eat it; probably,
says <i>M. Goupil</i>, because these fish, taking a
longer time to die, the poison is longer subjected to
the action of the digestive juices, and a considerable
quantity of it is consequently absorbed.<a id='r461' /><a href='#f461' class='c011'><sup>[461]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Late experiments<a id='r462' /><a href='#f462' class='c011'><sup>[462]</sup></a> have shewn that the active
principle of the <i>cocculus Indicus</i> is an alkaline body,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_425'>425</span>crystallizable, bitter, and extremely poisonous; to
this principle, <i>M. Boullay</i> has given the name of
<i>picrotoxine</i>, and the experiments of <i>M. Orfila</i> have
confirmed the idea of its constituting the only active
element of the seeds.</p>

<h4 class='c016'><span class='sc'>Poisonous Mushrooms.</span></h4>

<p class='c014'>The common mushroom, or champignon, (<i>Agaricus
Campestris</i>) has been long esteemed an article of epicurean
delicacy; and is eaten in its fresh state either
stewed or boiled; and as a preserve, in the form of
pickle or powder. Its juice, moreover, furnishes the
sauce so well known by the name of <i>ketchup</i>,<a id='r463' /><a href='#f463' class='c011'><sup>[463]</sup></a> or
<i>catsup</i>. <i>Mr. Miller</i> informs us that the true eatable
mushroom may be easily distinguished from the poisonous
and unpleasant species by the following characters.
“When young, it appears of a roundish
form, smooth, like a button; which together with
its stalk, is white, especially the fleshy part of
the button; the gills within, when broken, are
livid. As it grows larger, it expands its head
by degrees into a flat form; the gills underneath
are at first of a pale flesh-colour, but become
blackish on standing.” There are besides a vast
number of species which may be eaten with perfect
impunity; the Agaricus <i>Procerus</i>, or tall mushroom,
is sometimes exposed for sale in Covent Garden market,
and is quite harmless; although, when preserved
in pickle, it is very apt to run into the vinous
fermentation. With equal safety the Agaricus
<i>Pratensis</i>, or Scotch bonnet, as it has been called,
may be eaten; it occurs in those patches which are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_426'>426</span>well known by the popular name of <i>fairy rings</i>. The
Agaricus <i>deliciosus</i> is considered by <i>Withering</i> to
have been the mushroom which formed the vehicle
of poison to <i>Claudius Cæsar</i>, as related at page <a href='#Page_134'>134</a>
of this volume, and which has been celebrated by the
satiric pen of <i>Juvenal</i>, and the epigrammatic muse of
<i>Martial</i>; a species of mushroom, observes <i>Withering</i>
which is still highly esteemed in modern Italy, as it
was in ancient Rome. <i>Schæfer</i> and <i>Clusius</i>, however,
consider the plant in question to have been the
Agaricus <i>Xerampelinus</i>, a species which although
esculent, has a strong, and by no means an agreeable
flavour. The common champignon has never, as far as
we can learn, produced any mischief, although a popular
opinion prevails that soil, shade, and other
local circumstances, may render it virulent. If any
unpleasant symptoms were to follow its ingestion, we
should be inclined to regard them as the result of the
peculiar idiosyncrasy of the individual, rather than as
the consequence of an <em>absolute</em> poison; indeed a question
has been raised how far such an explanation
may not apply to all the cases of poisoning from this
tribe of plants; for it has been observed that in many
parts of Europe several of those species of mushroom
are eaten with impunity, that are regarded by us as
most virulent poisons; of this number we may reckon
the Agaricus <i>Piperatus</i>, or <i>Pepper Agaric</i>, which is
eaten in great quantity by the Russians, who fill
large vessels with them in the autumn, seasoning
or pickling them with salt, and then eating them in the
ensuing lent.<a id='r464' /><a href='#f464' class='c011'><sup>[464]</sup></a> There is, however, too much direct
evidence in favour of the existence of an acrid poison
in certain <i>Agarics</i>, to allow the supposition of their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_427'>427</span>being <em>relative</em><a id='r465' /><a href='#f465' class='c011'><sup>[465]</sup></a> in their operation, as exemplified
in the history of the <i>Agaricus Muscarius</i>, or <i>Bugagaric</i>,
which is so called from its power in destroying
these insects; and for which purpose the inhabitants
of the north of Europe infuse it in milk, and
set it in their windows. It constitutes the <i>Mouchomore</i>
of the Russians, Kamtschadales, and Koriars,
who use it for the sake of intoxication; upon some
occasions they eat it dry, but generally it is steeped
in a liquor made with the <i>Epilobium Angustifolium</i>;
upon drinking which, they are seized with
convulsions in all their limbs, followed by raving delirium:
an effect which renders it a desirable potation<a id='r466' /><a href='#f466' class='c011'><sup>[466]</sup></a>
to those who intend to accomplish any desperate
act, or premeditated assassination. It is also
stated that those who drink the urine of persons intoxicated
by this agaric, experience the effects of the
mushroom. <i>Withering</i>,<a id='r467' /><a href='#f467' class='c011'><sup>[467]</sup></a> who has been very assiduous
in the display of this species, acknowledges ten
varieties, all of which are natives of Britain. The
<i>Agaricus Semi-globalus</i> of this botanist, and which is
identical with the A. <i>Glutinosus</i> of Curtis, is extremely
poisonous, and has proved fatal in several instances
in this country. There are a great many other species
equally destructive, but notwithstanding the labour
that has been bestowed upon this branch of natural
knowledge, much remains to be explained.
The ancients appear to have taken considerable pains
in discriminating between esculent and poisonous
fungi; among the moderns, <i>Clusius</i> has furnished a
mass of information. <i>Withering</i> has described with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_428'>428</span>great botanical minuteness and accuracy the different
species and varieties of this extensive genus of the
cryptogamia; but he has failed in pointing out the
poisonous, from the esculent and harmless species.
<i>Orfila</i>, in his late lessons on Poisons,<a id='r468' /><a href='#f468' class='c011'><sup>[468]</sup></a> has bestowed
considerable labour with a view to establish a practical
distinction, and has enriched his work with highly
illustrative engravings. Upon the present occasion,
it is scarcely necessary to observe, that it would be
foreign to the plan of this work to enter into such botanical
details as the full elucidation of this subject
would require; the research would, in itself, occupy
a quarto volume; we must therefore rest satisfied
with general observations. The following indications
should excite a suspicion of mushrooms. A marshy
and shady locality; an ugly or lurid physiognomy;
a glairy or moist surface; a change of colour when
cut, and a soft, porous, and moist texture; a virulent
smell; a bright colour, or a combination of distinct
colours. We ought also to reject as dangerous
all those which have bulbous and soft stems, or
which have fragments of skin glued to their surface.</p>

<h5 class='c016'><i>Symptoms of poisoning by Mushrooms.</i></h5>

<p class='c014'>Exhilaration of spirits, laughter, vertigo, sickness,
griping pains, vomiting, and purging, suffusion
of the eyes, stupor, cold sweats, syncope, convulsions,
death. Numerous records of sickness and
death might be adduced in illustration of this subject.
The celebrated musician, <i>Schobert</i>, and, with
the exception of one child, his whole family, together
with a friend and a physician who dined with him,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_429'>429</span>were all fatally poisoned by a dish of mushrooms,
which he had himself gathered in the fields of Saint
Gervais, a village in the environs of Paris. It is not
known to what species the plants belonged. In the
<cite>Gazette de Santé</cite>, for August 1812, we have the following
narrative. “<i>M. Dufour</i>, a physician of Montargis,
gathered in the neighbouring forest some
mushrooms, which were stripped of their skin, and
their stem, cut into pieces, and cooked in their juice
with butter and fine herbs, under a camp oven. They
were served up at table. The servant girl, aged
twenty years, who had eaten the greatest quantity,
very shortly complained of confusion of the head,
giddiness, and a slight heaving of the stomach; her
face was red and inflamed, the eyes starting and
lively, the pulse full and undulating. The eldest
daughter of <i>M. Dufour</i> experienced the same symptoms
without any nausea. A little child, eighteen
months old, that had only eaten some bread dipped
in the gravy, slept quietly for sixteen hours, contrary
to his usual custom, and exhibited no other remarkable
phenomenon. The other child, aged eleven
years, complained of confusion of the head and intoxication;
the parents did not experience any ill effects.
Upon investigation it was discovered that two mushrooms
of the <i>Agaricus Muscarius</i>, having been confounded
with the proper one, had entered into the
composition of the dish.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Amongst the cases which have occurred in this
country, we may particularize that related by <i>Mr. E.
Brande</i>, in the third volume of the <cite>London Medical
and Physical Journal</cite>, p. 41, “J. S. gathered early
in the morning of the third of October, in the Green
Park, what he supposed to be small mushrooms;
these he stewed with the common additions in a <i>tinned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_430'>430</span>iron</i><a id='r469' /><a href='#f469' class='c011'><sup>[469]</sup></a> saucepan. The whole did not exceed a
tea-saucer full, which he, and four of his children ate
the first thing, about eight o’clock in the morning, as
they frequently had done without any bad consequence;
they afterwards took their usual breakfast of tea,
&amp;c., which was finished about nine, when <i>Edward</i>,
one of the children (eight years old) who had eaten a
large proportion of the fungi, was attacked with fits
of immoderate laughter, nor could the threats of his
father or mother restrain him. To this succeeded
vertigo, or stupor; the pupils of his eyes were, at
times, dilated to nearly the circumference of the cornea,
and scarcely contracted at the approach of a
strong light; his breathing was quick, his pulse very
variable, at times imperceptible, at others too frequent
and small to be counted, latterly very languid;
his feet were cold, livid, and contracted; he
sometimes pressed his hands on different parts of his
abdomen, as if in pain, but when roused and interrogated
respecting it, he <a id='ans'></a>answered yes, or no, evidently
without any relation to what was asked. About
the same time the father, aged forty, was attacked
with vertigo, and complained that every thing appeared
black, then wholly disappeared; to this
succeeded loss of voluntary motion and stupor; in
about ten minutes he gradually recovered, but complained
of universal numbness and coldness, with
great dejection, and a firm persuasion that he was
dying; in a few minutes he relapsed, but recovered
as before, and had several similar fits during three or
four hours, each succeeding one being less violent,
and with longer intermission than that <a id='pre'></a>preceding.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_431'>431</span><i>Harriet</i>, twelve years old, who had eaten but a very
small quantity, was also attacked at the time with
slight vertigo. <i>Charlotte</i>, a delicate little girl, ten
years of age, who had eaten a considerable quantity,
was suddenly attacked in the presence of <i>Dr. Burges</i>
and myself, with vertigo and loss of voluntary motion.
<i>Martha</i>, aged eighteen, who had eaten a small
proportion, was attacked with similar symptoms.”
By judicious treatment they all recovered. Upon investigation
<i>Mr. Sowerby</i> determined the mushroom
to have been a variety of the A. <i>glutinosus</i> of Curtis
(<i>Flora Londinensis</i>) the same with <i>Dr. Withering’s</i>
A. <i>semi-globatus</i>; and yet no notice of its deleterious
properties is taken by either of these botanists.</p>

<p class='c000'>A less fortunate case of poisoning by <i>Fungi</i> is related
in the twentieth volume of the same journal by
<i>Mr. Parrott</i>, surgeon of Mitcham, of which the following
is a sketch. The subject of the history was a
family of six persons, viz. <i>William Attwood</i>, ætat.
45; <i>Eliza</i>, his wife, 38; and their daughters, <i>Mary</i>,
æt. 14; <i>Hannah</i>, 11; <i>Sarah</i>, 7; <i>Eliza</i>, 5. They all
ate stewed champignons, at one o’clock, on Monday
the 10th of October, which stew was made in an iron
vessel, and consisted of the articles already mentioned
with the addition of butter and flour, pepper, salt,
and water only; and each of the parties (<i>Hannah</i>
excepted) was supposed to have eaten more than half
a pint. Within ten minutes after they had eaten
their meal, they felt their spirits exhilarated, and
the eldest daughter said to her mother “<em>how funny
you look</em>.” All the parties continued cheerful till
about six o’clock, when having taken their tea, they
were attacked with stupor, which was soon succeeded,
by severe pains in the bowels, accompanied with violent
vomiting, and copious purging, which continued
<span class='pageno' id='Page_432'>432</span>till the following afternoon, when the parents became
alarmed and sent for the surgeon. The treatment
which was pursued appears to have been, in every
respect, judicious, and <i>Mary</i> had so far recovered on
the following day (Wednesday) that she walked into
the village about a quarter of a mile from home; in
the evening, however, the symptoms returned; on
Thursday evening she became convulsed, and died on
Friday morning at two o’clock. <i>Eliza</i> did not complain
much of her sufferings, but became convulsed
at the same time as her sister, and died half an hour
after her. <i>Sarah</i> never complained of pain in the
head, but was continually suffering under extreme
pain in the bowels, which was aggravated by pressure,
but no tension existed; she died on Saturday
morning, in the same convulsed state as her sisters.
A dog which had partaken of the stew died on the
Wednesday night, apparently in great agony. The
father recovered, the mother, who was two months
advanced in pregnancy, miscarried, but ultimately
became convalescent. <i>Mr. Wheeler</i>, of St. Bartholomew’s
hospital, a gentleman who has been long
known to the profession as an eminent botanist, no
sooner heard of the event than he repaired to the
spot where the mushrooms had been gathered, when
he immediately recognised the <i>Agaricus semi-globatus</i>,
which had nearly proved fatal in the instance
related by <i>Mr. E. Brande</i>, and which, upon being
shewn to the father, he instantly pronounced to be
similar to those, of which the family had so unfortunately
eaten.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_433'>433</span>
  <h5 class='c016'><i>Organic Lesions discovered on Dissection.</i></h5>
</div>

<p class='c014'>In the above case of the family of <i>Attwood</i>, the
body of <i>Mary</i> was examined, but no morbid appearance
whatever could be discovered. In collecting the
different phenomena exhibited in other recorded
cases, they may be reduced to the following: “violet
coloured spots over the integuments; abdomen extremely
bulky; the <i>tunica conjunctiva</i> of the eye as
if it were injected; the pupil contracted; stomach
and intestines inflamed, and scattered over with gangrenous
spots; and, in some cases, they have exhibited
very considerable contractions, so much so as
almost to obliterate the canal. In no case have any
remains of the mushroom been found. The lungs
have been observed inflamed, and gorged with black
blood.”</p>

<p class='c000'>There cannot, however, be any doubt but that the
different species of poisonous agarics act very differently.</p>

<h5 class='c016'><i>Antidotes.</i></h5>

<p class='c014'>In all cases, the first object is to evacuate the offensive
matter by emetics. After which, stimulants, especially
<i>ammonia</i>, will be found highly serviceable.</p>

<h4 class='c016'><span class='sc'>Alcohol.</span></h4>

<p class='c014'>In treating of the action of this substance upon the
human body, it may be considered as a slow, or
quick poison; as one which, according to the circumstances
of its administration, may either implant the
seeds of disease and death, by an insidious, and
scarcely perceptible operation, or extinguish the
principle of animation in the space of a few hours.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_434'>434</span>Its effects as an <em>accumulative</em><a id='r470' /><a href='#f470' class='c011'><sup>[470]</sup></a> poison are principally
interesting to the physician in their relations to
therapeutics, although their history may perhaps suggest
some few points of interest to the founders of
medical police.</p>

<p class='c000'>We shall, therefore, observe, with regard to the
habitual use of fermented liquors, that the bodily
evils which arise from the custom rather depend upon
the quality, or, in other words, the state of combination
in which the alcohol exists in such liquors,
than on the absolute quantity of the libation, or the
frequency with which it is repeated. Daily experience
convinces us that the same quantity of alcohol
applied to the stomach under the form of wine, and
in a state of mixture with water, will produce very
different effects upon the living body, as well with
reference to the immediate symptoms, as to the remote
consequences of the potation; it has, for instance,
been clearly demonstrated that port, madeira,
and sherry, contain from one-fourth to one-fifth
their bulk of alcohol;<a id='r471' /><a href='#f471' class='c011'><sup>[471]</sup></a> so that a person who takes a
bottle of either of these wines, will thus take nearly
half a pint of pure alcohol, which is equivalent to a
pint of brandy! The remote consequences too of
alcohol in these different states, are as striking and
distinct as their immediate effects. It is well known
that diseases of the liver are the most common, and
the most formidable of those produced by the use of
<i>ardent</i> spirits; it is equally certain that no such disorders
follow the intemperate use of wine that is perfectly
<i>pure</i>; let it be remembered that the greater
<span class='pageno' id='Page_435'>435</span>proportion of that which is drunk in this country
contains uncombined brandy, purposely added to
meet the demand of the British market; and <i>Dr.
MacCulloch</i> thinks that it is to the unwitting and concealed
consumption of this uncombined spirit, that we
ought to attribute the prevalence of those hepatic
affections which are comparatively little known to
our continental neighbours. But although wine, in
a state of purity, may be thus fairly excluded from
the general obloquy which attaches to spirituous potations,
it must not be regarded as entirely free from
imputation. “The effects of wine,” says <i>Rush</i> “like
those of tyranny in a well formed government, are
first felt in the extremities; while spirits, like a bold
invader, seize at once upon the vitals of the constitution.”
And even with respect to ardent spirits, although
they can only be regarded as diluted alcohol,
still each species appears to possess a peculiarity of
operation; owing, no doubt, to the modifying influence
of the other elements of the liquid; thus <i>brandy</i><a id='r472' /><a href='#f472' class='c011'><sup>[472]</sup></a>
is said to be cordial and stomachic; <i>rum</i> more
heating and sudorific; <i>gin</i> and <i>whiskey</i>, diuretic;
and <i>arrack</i>, styptic, heating, and narcotic. It seems
also that a modified effect is produced by the addition
of various other substances, such as sugar and acids;
which latter bodies, besides their anti-narcotic powers,
appear to act by favouring a more perfect combination
and mutual penetration of the particles of spirit
and water. The effects also which are produced by
the habitual use of fermented liquors differ essentially
<span class='pageno' id='Page_436'>436</span>according to the kind that is drunk; thus ale
and porter, in consequence of the nutritive matter,
and perhaps the invigorating bitter with which they
are charged, and the comparatively small proportion
of alcohol which they contain, dispose to plethora,
which is sometimes terminated by apoplexy.<a id='r473' /><a href='#f473' class='c011'><sup>[473]</sup></a></p>

<h5 class='c016'><i>Symptoms of Poisoning by Alcohol.</i></h5>

<p class='c014'>The ordinary effects of an excessive dose of any
spirituous liquor are too well known to require description;
and generally pass off without the necessity
of professional interference. In cases, however,
where the draught has been very large, the person
has suddenly fallen down in a state of complete insensibility,
and has exhibited all the phenomena of apoplexy;
or, in some instances, he has expired almost
immediately. The insensibility of the patient may
render it difficult for the practitioner to distinguish
the immediate cause of the symptoms; although
his history for the last few hours, and the spirituous
odour of his breath, will generally announce
the true nature of his situation. <i>Mr. Brodie</i> observes
that there is a striking analogy between the symptoms
arising from the ingestion of spirits, and those produced
by injuries of the brain; concussion of the
brain, which may be considered the slightest degree
of injury, occasions a state of mind resembling intoxication;
pressure on the brain, which is a more
severe injury than concussion, produces loss of motion,
insensibility, dilation of the pupils, laborious
and stertorous respiration, and death.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_437'>437</span>
  <h5 class='c016'><i>Physiological Action of Alcohol.</i></h5>
</div>

<p class='c014'>We shall not enter into the history of the slow
operation of repeated doses of spirit upon the human
body; but limit our present inquiry to the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">modus
operandi</span></i> of this agent, as a quick and destructive
poison.</p>

<p class='c000'>Large draughts of liquids containing alcohol,
would appear to destroy, at once, the functions of
the brain, without occasioning that previous stage of
excitement, which is produced by smaller quantities
of spirit—whence coma and insensibility are the immediate
consequences; and the nervous energy being
no longer conveyed to the muscles of respiration, the
breathing becomes laborious, and the patient dies,
as he does in apoplexy, for want of those changes in
the blood which are produced by the respiratory
functions.<a id='r474' /><a href='#f474' class='c011'><sup>[474]</sup></a> In the greater number, however, of
fatal cases of inebriety, life has been destroyed by
circumstances purely accidental; such as improvident
<span class='pageno' id='Page_438'>438</span>exposure to cold, as explained at <i>page</i> <a href='#Page_59'>59</a>, or suffocation
from an imperfect act of vomiting, during
which a portion of the contents of the stomach are
forced into the trachea, (<i>see page</i> <a href='#Page_58'>58</a>,<a id='r475' /><a href='#f475' class='c011'><sup>[475]</sup></a>.) It having
then been clearly established that the brain is the
organ principally affected by a large dose of alcohol,
it remains to be explained in what manner, and
through what medium such an effect is produced;
upon this question we are inclined to concur with
<i>Mr. Brodie</i>, and to consider that alcohol acts sympathetically
on the brain by means of the nerves of the
stomach; for it has been observed that animals
which die under such circumstances, exhibit a decided
inflammation of the stomach; and, in the next
place, the effects produced by this agent are too instantaneous
to admit the possibility of absorption,
while repeated instances have shewn that vomiting
will often restore the intoxicated individual to his
senses. At the same time, we think it very probable
that, upon some occasions, the alcohol passes into
the current of the circulation, and is thus carried to
remote organs. <i>Dr. Cooke</i><a id='r476' /><a href='#f476' class='c011'><sup>[476]</sup></a> has related a case, on
the authority of <i>Sir A. Carlisle</i>, of a person who was
brought dead into the Westminster hospital, in consequence
of having drunk a quart of gin for a wager,
at a draught; and that upon examination, a considerable
quantity of a limpid fluid was found within
the lateral ventricles of the brain, <em>distinctly impregnated
with gin</em>. We well remember this case, for it
occurred during the period that the author of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_439'>439</span>present work held the situation of physician to that
hospital. See <cite>Pharmacologia</cite>, vol. 1, p. 138.</p>

<h5 class='c016'><i>Treatment of Persons in a State of Inebriety.</i></h5>

<p class='c014'>In the first instance we should endeavour to evacuate
the stomach; for which purpose a brisk emetic
of sulphate of zinc, or tartarised antimony may be administered.
Blood should also be taken from the jugular
vein, or temporal artery; more especially if there
appear a considerable determination of blood to the
head. The head should be also washed with cold
water, or some evaporating lotion.</p>

<p class='c000'>For reasons which we have already explained, the
patient should be carefully preserved in a warm atmosphere;
and his body should be placed in an easy
reclining posture, and be disencumbered of all tight
bandages. These precautions are of the utmost moment,
for many of those cases of inebriety which
stand recorded in our journals, have terminated
fatally, for want of attention to them.</p>

  <h4 class='c016'>ANIMAL POISONS.</h4>
</div>

<p class='c014'>This extensive kingdom of Nature presents us
with a variety of objects destructive to human life;
their agency, however, is on many occasions involved
in impenetrable obscurity, and we are not even able
to discover whether their deleterious effects depend
upon certain definite principles, or upon the combination
of circumstances connected with the individuals
upon whom they act; and which thus render
many substances <em>relatively</em> poisonous, that are innocuous
to the general mass of mankind. With regard
to the chemical laws by which animal compounds are
governed, and the principles upon which their analysis
may be conducted, the same observations will
apply as those with which we introduced the consideration
of vegetable poisons.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>Cl. IV. SEPTIC POISONS.</h3>
<h4 class='c016'><span class='sc'>The Bites of Venomous Animals.</span></h4>

<p class='c014'>Of the whole class of serpents, which according to
<i>Linnæus</i> contains 132 species, <i>Plenck</i> assures us
that only 24 are venomous. Of these, Europe has
only 5, and England but 2; all of which are vipers,
viz. <i>Coluber Aspis</i>; <i>C. Chersea</i>; <i>C. Prester</i> (<i>black
viper</i>, peculiar to England); <i>C. Illyricus</i> (inhabits the
mountains of Sclavonia); <i>C. Berus</i>, (the common
viper of Germany, Spain, Italy, and England.)</p>

<p class='c000'>The venom of the viper is contained in a bag situated
on both sides of the head, beneath the muscle
<span class='pageno' id='Page_441'>441</span>of the superior jaw; it is secreted from the blood by
a gland which lies just behind the orbit of the eye;
from which a duct proceeds to the above-mentioned
bag; in the upper jaw are situated two moveable
teeth, very sharp towards the point, and hollowed
nearly throughout their length. When the animal
intends to bite, he presses the bag by means of the
muscle, the venom comes out, arrives at the base of
the tooth, passes through the sheath which envelopes
it, and enters into its cavity by a hole which is found
at this base; then it flows along the hollow of the
tooth, and issues into the wound by the opening
which is near its end, for the point itself is solid and
sharp, in order that it may better penetrate the flesh
of its victim. If these fangs be removed, or their
structure destroyed, the viper is necessarily rendered
harmless; whence <i>Galen</i> has observed that the mountebanks
used to stop these perforations of the teeth
with some kind of paste, whenever they suffered the
vipers to bite them before spectators.</p>

<h5 class='c016'><i>Symptoms occasioned by the Bite of a Viper.</i></h5>

<p class='c014'>Acute pain in the wounded part, attended with
almost immediate tumefaction; the part appears
first red, and then livid; the local affection extends
itself, and the surrounding skin becomes similarly
affected. The pulse is small, frequent, and irregular;
the respiration is disturbed; the patient complains
of great debility, and faintness which often
amounts to syncope; vomiting takes place; pain is
felt in the umbilical region, and he becomes jaundiced;
and, in fatal cases, the wound assumes a malignant
character, and gangrene takes place.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_442'>442</span>In this country the affection is rarely mortal,<a id='r477' /><a href='#f477' class='c011'><sup>[477]</sup></a> although
the circumstances of constitutional debility,
unusual heat of season, and injudicious treatment,
have in several instances led to a fatal issue.</p>

<h5 class='c016'><i>Physiological action of the Poison of Vipers.</i></h5>

<p class='c014'>The result of numerous experiments justify us in
referring this poison to the second division of our classification.
The symptoms which it produces evidently
depend on its absorption, and its passage into
the circulation, when it exerts its peculiar action on
the blood. It is somewhat singular that this poison
should be perfectly inert when taken into the stomach;
a fact, however, which appears to have been
well known from the earliest periods; whence such
wounds were commonly sucked<a id='r478' /><a href='#f478' class='c011'><sup>[478]</sup></a> with impunity;
and we learn that when <i>Cato</i> marched the remains of
<i>Pompey’s</i> army through Africa, he very wisely informed
the soldiers, who, although dying from thirst,
feared to drink the waters which contained serpents,
that no evil could arise from such indulgence.<a id='r479' /><a href='#f479' class='c011'><sup>[479]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Among the insects of Britain some will be found to
possess fluids highly stimulant, and sometimes, although
rarely, occasioning death. These British
insects, however, cannot be compared in virulence
with the <i>Furia Infernalis</i>, <i>Pulex Penetrans</i>, the
<i>Scorpion</i>, and the <i>Tarantula</i>; but their natural history
<span class='pageno' id='Page_443'>443</span>is nevertheless interesting, and the instances of
mischief arising from an application of their venom
are not unimportant. Of the genus <i>Vespa</i> we have
three species, each of which possesses the property of
producing violent and painful inflammation, sometimes
followed by considerable danger, where the
injury has been inflicted on parts of great sensibility,
and in irritable habits, viz. Vespa <i>Crabro</i>, the <i>hornet</i>;
V. <i>Vulgaris</i>, <i>common wasp</i>; C. <i>Coarctata</i>, <i>small
wasp</i>. Instances are recorded of the wasp, having
been introduced into the mouth with fruit, and produced
by its sting on the <i>velum palati</i> a sudden swelling
which has so intercepted the respiration as to occasion
suffocation.<a id='r480' /><a href='#f480' class='c011'><sup>[480]</sup></a> Of the <i>Apis</i> there are seven
British species; the most remarkable of which are the
Apis <i>Rufa</i>, or <i>small field bee</i>; A. <i>Mellifica</i>, <i>the common
hive bee</i>; A. <i>Terrestris</i>, <i>humble bee</i>; and A.
<i>Subterranea</i>, or <i>great humble bee</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>The sting of a single bee cannot be regarded as attended
with danger, except in certain constitutions;
but there are many instances of men and animals having
suffered most terribly, and even fatally, by an
attack of a swarm of these insects.</p>

<p class='c000'>The supposed poison of the toad is a subject which
we have already disposed of, under the literary history
of poisons, <i>page</i> <a href='#Page_139'>139</a>.</p>

<h4 class='c016'><span class='sc'>Putrescent Animal Matter.</span></h4>

<p class='c014'>A question has long since arisen, how far the ingestion
of animal matter, in a state of putrefaction,
is liable to affect the health? On the one hand it has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_444'>444</span>been maintained that the custom of eating game, venison,
and other species of animal food, in a state of
incipient putrescence, has never been attended with
any inconvenience; but appears, on the contrary, to
afford a repast of easier digestion, than the flesh of
recently killed animals. On the other hand, it has
been asserted by <i>Foderé</i>,<a id='r481' /><a href='#f481' class='c011'><sup>[481]</sup></a> and corroborated by the
testimony of others, that corrupted meat, fish, and
eggs, are undoubted poisons; if, through inadvertence,
necessity, or extreme hunger, they are taken
in any quantity. The same distinguished writer relates
that, during the siege of Mantua, several persons
who were shut up in the town were seized with
gangrene of the extremities, and scurvy, in consequence
of having been driven to the alternative of
eating the half putrid flesh of horses. In <i>Crantz’s</i>
history of Greenland we read an account of the death
of thirty-two persons, at a missionary station, called
Kangek, shortly after a repast upon the putrid brains
of a Walrus.</p>

<p class='c000'>It would appear that under circumstances not
hitherto understood, certain parts of animal bodies
become poisonous; and the <i>virus</i> would not seem to
be connected with any stage of putrefaction, nor with
any previous disease in the animal. As far as our
limited experience upon this subject will allow us to
generalize, the brain and the viscera would appear to
be particularly susceptible of such a change. Some
curious and highly interesting observations have
lately been published by <i>Dr. Kerner</i>, of Wurtemberg,
respecting the probable existence of a species
of animal poison not hitherto known. He informs
us that the smoked sausages, which constitute so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_445'>445</span>favourite a repast to the inhabitants of Wurtemberg,
often cause fatal poisoning. The effects of the
poison occasionally manifest themselves in the spring,
generally in the month of April, in a degree more or
less alarming. He states that out of <em>seventy-six</em> persons,
who became sick from having eaten such sausages,
<em>thirty-seven</em> died in a short time, and that several
others remained ill for years. Upon these
occasions it has been observed, that the most virulent
sausages were made of liver. <i>M. Cadet</i>, of Paris,
analysed all the meats, examined all the vessels in
which they had been prepared; and inspected the matters
vomited, or found in the stomach after death, without
being able to trace the vestige of any known poison;
nor was there the slightest evidence in these
cases of malevolence or negligence. Similar accidents
have occurred at different periods in Paris; upon
which occasions, the police officers visited the pig
dealers, and were perfectly assured that the animals
had never been fed with unwholesome food; the use
of poison for rats, with which these places abound,
was interdicted, and every precaution taken. What
then, asks <i>M. Cadet</i>, is this poison found in sausage
meats—is it Prussic acid—is it a new matter? It is
evidently not the effect of putrefaction, since it exists
in meats perfectly well preserved. To the above
queries of <i>M. Cadet</i>, the author of the present work
begs to add one more—may not the skin enclosing
the sausage meat be the part in which the poison resides?
It is well known that the bodies of animals
who die of various diseases, are capable of communicating
fatal diseases to the human species; and experience
has shewn that such animal poison is particularly
energetic in those parts that are commonly
called the <i>offals</i>, in which term are included the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_446'>446</span>intestines; in the history of <i>fish-poison</i>, which will
hereafter offer itself to our notice, we shall find
numerous instances of dogs, cats, hogs, and birds,
dying from eating these parts, while persons, who
have partaken of the fish to which these <i>offals</i> belonged,
remained uninjured. But to account for
the deleterious change of which these parts appear
to be occasionally susceptible, it does not appear necessary
to suppose that the animal died in a state of
disease. <i>Captain Scoresby</i>, in his “Account of the
Arctic regions,”<a id='r482' /><a href='#f482' class='c011'><sup>[482]</sup></a> states that although the flesh of the
bear is both agreeable and wholesome, the liver of
that animal is poisonous; sailors who had inadvertently
eaten it, were almost always sick afterwards,
and some actually died; while in others the
cuticle has peeled off their bodies. The ancients appear
to have entertained a fear with regard to the
wholesomeness of the viscera of certain animals, and
of the fluids which they secrete. <i>Pliny</i> says that the
gall of a horse was accounted poison; and, therefore,
at the sacrifices of horses in Rome, it was unlawful
for the <i>Flamen</i> (priest) to touch it. <i>Mr. Brodie</i> has
lately favoured the author with the communication of
a fact, which goes far to support the theory we have
offered with respect to the possible source of poison
in sausages. He states that he has twice met with
evidence of the acrid and poisonous nature of “<i>dog’s
meat</i>,” as sold in the streets of London, which manifested
itself by producing ulcerations, of a peculiar
character, on the hands, and swelling in the axillæ,
of the venders! May we venture to ask whether the
prosecution of this inquiry might not possibly lead to
some new and important conclusions respecting the
origin of hydrophobia?</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_447'>447</span>Where animals have died from disease, their flesh has
undoubtedly produced affections by external contact,
as well as by its ingestion. At the Somerset assizes in
1819, a case was tried, whose merits wholly turned
upon the question now under discussion. A cow, having
died of some disease, was thrown into the river
Yeo, and several cattle that afterwards drank of the
water died of a similar complaint. An action was accordingly
brought against the owner of the cow for damages.
The defendant, however, obtained a verdict,
apparently from the evidence of a medical person, who
asserted that animal matter in a state of putrefaction
will not communicate contagion. But we must here
beg to observe that this is quite another and distinct
question; the merits of which we have already considered.<a id='r483' /><a href='#f483' class='c011'><sup>[483]</sup></a>
The physiological question involved in
the preceding case, is whether the carcase of an animal,
whose fluids have been depraved by antecedent
disease, is capable, or not, of producing morbid and
fatal affections in the living animals with which it
may come in contact? The facts collected by <i>MM.
Enaux</i> and <i>Chaussier</i>, in their work entitled “<cite>Methode
de traiter les Morsures des Animaux enragés</cite>,”
prove in a very satisfactory manner that the <i>Anthrax</i>,
or <i>Malignant Pustule</i>, has for its cause a <i>septic virus</i>
engendered in diseased animals, and transmitted to
man.<a id='r484' /><a href='#f484' class='c011'><sup>[484]</sup></a> The following are amongst the more striking
examples cited from these authors by <i>Orfila</i>. “A
shepherd bled one of his sheep, which had just died
suddenly; he carried it home on his shoulders; but
the blood penetrated his shirt, and was rubbed upon
his loins. Two days after, a <i>malignant pustule</i> appeared
upon this spot.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_448'>448</span>“A boy employed in skinning an ox which had
been killed at an inn at <i>Gatinais</i>, because it had been
sick, put the knife into his mouth. Shortly after
which the tongue swelled; he experienced a tightness
of the chest; the whole body was covered with
pustules, and he died on the fourth day, in a state of
general gangrene. The inn-keeper, who was pricked
in the middle of the hand by a bone of the same animal,
suffered great pain; gangrene seized the arm,
and he expired on the seventh day. The servant
girl received on her right cheek a few drops of the
blood of the same ox, which produced inflammation,
followed by gangrene.”</p>

<p class='c000'>In this country, a case has occurred highly illustrative
of the present subject. A pupil of the veterinary
college accidentally inoculated himself, during
his dissection, with the matter of a <i>glandered</i> horse;
the student soon experienced the usual symptoms of
a septic poison; abscesses formed in various parts of
his body, and he sank under the disease. Upon inoculating
a healthy horse with some of the matter
from the abscesses, the animal was attacked with the
glanders.</p>

<p class='c000'>This subject necessarily leads us to the notice
of those effects which are frequently produced in
the anatomist, by a puncture made during dissection.
From the history of those cases which stand recorded,
it does not appear that the poisonous effects are either
connected with the putrefactive state of the body
under dissection, or with the peculiar disease of
which it died; but rather with the depraved state of
the operator’s health; for it has been repeatedly remarked
that those students who enjoy high health
universally escape the evil, however repeatedly they
may have been exposed to its causes.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_449'>449</span>
  <h4 class='c016'><span class='sc'>Poisonous Fishes.</span></h4>
</div>

<p class='c014'>The number and validity of recorded cases establish
the fact, beyond dispute, that certain fish, especially
the muscle, (<i>Mytilus Edulis</i>) and others of the shell
tribe, have occasionally proved fatal to those who
have eaten them; but it has been doubted whether
such effects have arisen from a specific poison, or
from the peculiar state of the stomach,<a id='r485' /><a href='#f485' class='c011'><sup>[485]</sup></a> or <a id='idi'></a>idiosyncrasy
of constitution, in the persons affected. In
other words, ought we to consider the fish, so circumstanced,
as an <em>absolute</em> or <em>relative</em> poison? Each
of these theories has met with its advocates, and many
striking facts and illustrations have been adduced in
their support. The weight of authority, however,
as well as of argument, strongly inclines in favour of
the existence of a specific virus, generated under circumstances
which we are at present unable to appreciate.
At the same time, it would be vain to deny,
that certain fishes are more obnoxious to the stomach
of one individual than to that of another; there are,
for instance, those persons who are disordered whenever
they eat a muscle; others who are incapable of
taking an oyster without considerable disturbance of
the digestive functions. This is obviously <i>Idiosyncrasy</i>,
and must not be confounded with those cases
where a number of persons have been simultaneously
affected from a particular food, which, on all former
occasions, had been eaten by the same individuals
with perfect security. We must, therefore, at the
very outset of our inquiry, admit the occasional action
<span class='pageno' id='Page_450'>450</span>of these articles of diet as <em>relative</em> poisons;
although it is evident to demonstration, that an <em>absolute</em>
virus is generated in particular fishes, by the operation
of causes hitherto unknown.</p>

<p class='c000'>As a subject, highly important in its relations to
maritime œconomy, the history of fish-poison constitutes
an interesting branch of naval hygiene; instructions,
therefore, for its investigation, ought always
to be given to the naturalists and chemists who may
be appointed to attend voyages of discovery. The
notice of the scientific men who accompanied <i>Peyrouse</i>
was officially directed to this important object;
but the unhappy fate of that celebrated adventurer
rendered the commission fruitless. The obscurity
which attends this branch of toxicology has in many
cases occasioned a corresponding degree of credulity;
and sailors, as well as others, entertain an unfounded
prejudice against various fish, that are not only
innocuous, but even useful as articles of food. It
would, however, appear that those which are harmless
in one latitude may prove poisonous in another;
it may be stated generally, that fish are more deleterious
within the tropics, than in other seas.
In torrid regions the softest kinds are the most susceptible
of that change which renders them poisonous,
and hence the policy of the Hebrew legislator
becomes apparent; “<em>whatsoever has no fins nor scales
in the waters, that shall be an abomination unto you.</em>”
Levit. c. xi, v. 12, and Deut. cxiv, v. 9, 10.</p>

<h5 class='c016'><i>Symptoms of Fish-poisoning.</i></h5>

<p class='c014'>Nausea; thirst; tormina of the bowels; vomiting;
an eruption on the skin, resembling the nettle-rash;
tumefaction of the face; head-ache; difficult respiration;
distention of the abdomen; sometimes <i>cholera
morbus</i>; vertigo; delirium; cold sweats; convulsions;
death. Such is the train of symptoms, liable
of course, to variation in the order of succession,
which are produced by the ingestion of fish-poison,
as occasionally existing in salmon, herrings, eels,
mackarel, many of the testaceous and most of the
crustaceous fish of this country; and in a great number
of fish<a id='r488' /><a href='#f488' class='c011'><sup>[488]</sup></a> inhabiting the tropical seas.</p>

<p class='c000'>The species of fish, from which deleterious effects
have more commonly arisen in this country, are the
<i>Mytilus Edulis</i>, or muscle. <i>Dr. Burrows</i> has given
us an account of two cases of death from eating these
fish, which occurred at Gravesend, under the care of
<i>Mr. Rogers</i>, surgeon of that place, upon whose
<span class='pageno' id='Page_452'>452</span>authority the statement is drawn up.<a id='r489' /><a href='#f489' class='c011'><sup>[489]</sup></a> The subjects
of the history were two youths of the ages of
nine and fourteen, who had each eaten about a dozen
of small muscles, which they had picked from the
side of a fishing smack, in a dead and tainted state.
In the <cite>Gazette de Santé</cite>,<a id='r490' /><a href='#f490' class='c011'><sup>[490]</sup></a> and in the works of <i>Fodéré</i>,<a id='r491' /><a href='#f491' class='c011'><sup>[491]</sup></a>
and <i>Behren</i>,<a id='r492' /><a href='#f492' class='c011'><sup>[492]</sup></a> similar cases are recorded.
<i>Vancouver</i>,<a id='r493' /><a href='#f493' class='c011'><sup>[493]</sup></a> in his voyage to the coast of America,
relates that several of his men were ill from eating
some muscles which they had collected and roasted
for breakfast; in an hour after which they complained
of numbness of the face and extremities, sickness, and
giddiness. Three were more affected than the others,
and one of them died.</p>

<h5 class='c016'><i>Origin of Fish-poison.</i></h5>

<p class='c014'>If we admit that the symptoms which are occasionally
produced by the ingestion of certain fish, depend
upon the presence of poison, we have next to inquire
into its nature and origin. <i>Dr. Burrows</i> considers
that all the opinions which have been advanced upon
this subject may, for the greater perspicuity and facility
of discussion, be arranged under seven heads, viz.
does the poison exist—1. <i>In the skin?</i>—2. <i>In the
stomach and intestinal canal?</i>—3. <i>In the liver or gall
bladder?</i>—4. <i>In the entire substance of the fish?</i>—5.
<i>In the food of fishes?</i>—6. <i>Is it a morbid change in the
system of the fish?</i>—7. <i>Is it a poison, sui generis?</i></p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_453'>453</span>Upon these several questions <i>Dr. Burrows</i> has
offered some observations. There do not appear to
be any facts which can induce us to consider that the
poison resides only in the skin.</p>

<p class='c000'>Experience has shewn that the <i>virus</i> is particularly
energetic in the viscera, commonly called the <i>offals</i>;
and yet there are no grounds for concluding that it
exclusively belongs to these parts. <i>Captain Cook</i>,
and <i>Messrs. Forster</i> were poisoned by eating a piece
of the liver only of a species of <i>tetrodon</i>; yet they
who ate of its substance were also poisoned.</p>

<p class='c000'>An opinion has long prevailed that the poisonous
principle is derived from the substances upon which
the fish feeds; and that of muscles, in particular,
from copper; this latter hypothesis has received the
sanction of <i>Dr. Chisholm</i>. We however agree with
<i>Dr. Burrows</i> in considering that it has neither the
support of observation or analogy. <i>Dr. Beune</i> has
supposed that the acrid principle is no other than the
spawn of the <i>stella marina</i>, an insect which very commonly
lodges in the muscle. It seems, however,
more probable that it is a product of decomposition,
but which requires the concurrence of certain circumstances
for its developement.</p>

<p class='c000'>Before we conclude the history of septic poisons,
there appears to be a species of death, particularly
noticed by <i>Dr. Gordon Smith</i>,<a id='r494' /><a href='#f494' class='c011'><sup>[494]</sup></a> which merits our
attention, as having some relation to this class of
agents—the fact of persons having been “<em>eaten to
death by maggots</em>!” Such a death has been assigned
to <i>Sylla</i>, by <i>Plutarch</i>; and to <i>Antiochus Epiphanes</i>,
by <i>Josephus</i>, and the writer of the book of Maccabees.
The fate of <i>Herod</i> is ascertained by Scripture. In
<span class='pageno' id='Page_454'>454</span>modern history we have similar instances in <i>Charles</i>
IX of France, and <i>Philip</i> II of Spain.</p>

<p class='c000'>Numerous cases are recorded, in different medical
works,<a id='r495' /><a href='#f495' class='c011'><sup>[495]</sup></a> of the generation of maggots, <i>i. e.</i> the <i>larvæ</i>
of different species of fly, not only in external sores
and excoriations, but in the internal cavities of the
human body. <i>Dr. Lempriere</i><a id='r496' /><a href='#f496' class='c011'><sup>[496]</sup></a> has related the
case of an officer’s lady, who had gone through an
acute fever, but in whom these maggots were produced,
which burrowed, and found their way by the
nose through the <i>os cribriforme</i>, into the cavity of the
cranium, and afterwards into the brain itself, to
which she owed her death. But of all the cases of
this kind, that related by <i>Dr. Gordon Smith</i> is of the
most revolting kind. “In the month of July 1809,
a man was found near Finglas, in Ireland, lying
under the wall of a lime-kiln, at an early hour in the
evening, with his face on the ground, apparently
dead. On turning him on his back to ascertain the
real state of the case, it was discovered that he was
yet alive, but under the most appalling circumstances.
On removing his coat, the whole surface
of his body appeared to be a moving mass of worms.
His face was considerably injured as if from a fall, or
bruises; his eyes were dissolved, and their cavities,
as well as those of the ears, nose, and mouth, were
filled with a white living mass, from which such innumerable
quantities of maggots were continually
pouring out, that the skull seemed to be filled with
nothing else. After some time he recovered strength
enough to walk, and regained recollection and voice
sufficient to tell who he was, where he lived, and how
<span class='pageno' id='Page_455'>455</span>he had been brought into that situation. It appeared
that he was returning home upon a car the evening
before; having drank to excess, he fell off, and remained
in a state of insensibility until he was discovered.
He could neither account for the wounds in
his head, nor for his being so far from the road; but
it appeared probable that he had received the contusion
from the fall, and had insensibly crawled to the
place where he lay. It was conjectured that the state
of the atmosphere, as to humidity and temperature,
had brought on a solution of the solids in the bruised
parts, already disposed to putrescency, and now in
close contact with the moist earth. In these, the eggs
of innumerable insects being deposited, their generation
proceeded with rapidity under circumstances so
favourable. Every attention was paid to the unfortunate
individual; he was removed to shelter,
the parts were washed with spirits and vinegar, and
the loathsome objects removed, as far as was possible.
Cordials were poured down his throat, but he swallowed
with difficulty; and in a very short time spasms
took place which prevented him from swallowing
altogether. The putrescence advanced; in a short
time he became insensible; and about noon the following
day he died, in a state of total <i>putrisolution</i>.”</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_456'>456</span>
  <h4 class='c016'>AERIAL POISONS.</h4>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Under this division we include all those deleterious
substances which can be administered through the
medium of the atmosphere.</p>

<p class='c000'>Those gases, the respiration of which occasions
death by the negative operation of excluding oxygen,
are not ranked under the class of poisons, for the history
of such bodies involves physiological views peculiar
to themselves, and belongs more correctly to
the subject of suffocation, under which head it has
already met with full consideration, <i>vol.</i> 2, <i>p.</i> 48.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Aërial poisons</i> are of very undefined extent, and
their history is involved in considerable obscurity.
Every poison, capable of volatilization, may be admitted
into the division; and even those substances
which are generally regarded as fixed, may be mechanically
suspended in the air, and thus produce their
effects on the living system, through the medium of
the lungs, stomach, or nerves. In the present state
of our knowledge, we have, perhaps, only an imperfect
idea of the distinction between a fixed and a volatile
body. A very interesting paper on this subject
was read before the Royal Academy of Berlin, by
<i>Professor Hermbstaed</i>,<a id='r497' /><a href='#f497' class='c011'><sup>[497]</sup></a> in which he observes that,
generally speaking, we might consider all bodies as
volatile, as it is most probable that, could we produce
a sufficient degree of heat, no substance could
resist it. The professor also states that many bodies,
hitherto considered as fixed, are actually volatilized
at the temperature of boiling water; such he found to
be <i>lime</i>, <i>baryta</i>, <i>strontia</i>, and <i>potass</i>. We apprehend,
however, that the professor has, in these instances,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_457'>457</span>mistaken a phenomenon for <i>volatility</i>, which it is
highly important to distinguish from it, viz. <em>the elevation
of a certain portion of a fixed body, by the carrying
power of a vapour</em>; thus, fixed oil may, in a minute
proportion, be carried up with the steam of
water. Certain bodies, however, which have been
long considered as perfectly fixed at the ordinary
temperature of the atmosphere, have been lately discovered
to undergo a slow and almost imperceptible
evaporation under such circumstances; and the discovery
has led to a very satisfactory solution of several
problems which were previously unintelligible.
We shall adduce a striking exemplification of this
truth, under the consideration of mercurial vapours.</p>

<p class='c000'>The substances, included under the head of <i>Aërial
poisons</i>, may be conveniently arranged in two orders,
viz.</p>

<p class='c015'>I. Those, whose particles exist mechanically suspended
in the atmosphere.</p>
<p class='c015'>II. Those, which are presented to us in a <i>vaporous</i>
or <i>gaseous</i> form.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of the first division the various arts will furnish
ample illustration, as for instance the occupations
of the colour-maker, plasterer, cotton-spinner, dry-grinder,<a id='r498' /><a href='#f498' class='c011'><sup>[498]</sup></a>
stone-cutter, hatter, furrier, miller, &amp;c.
&amp;c. In all of which a subtle matter is given off,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_458'>458</span>which becoming mechanically suspended in the air,
penetrates the structure of the pulmonary organs, and
excites disease, and even death.<a id='r499' /><a href='#f499' class='c011'><sup>[499]</sup></a> In illustration
of the second division, we have the trades of water-gilders,
acid manufacturers, night-men, bleachers,
and various others, many of which have been already
noticed under the medical and chemical consideration
of nuisances, <i>vol.</i> I, <i>p.</i> 330.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the present chapter we cannot attempt an enumeration
of every substance which may act as an
aërial poison; we shall confine our attention to the
history of a few bodies which are calculated to afford
general elucidation, and are likely to become objects
of forensic interest.</p>

<h5 class='c016'><span class='sc'>Mercurial Vapours.</span></h5>

<p class='c014'>It is not the least interesting fact in the history of
aërial poisons, that substances, which are found to
be extremely slow in their action, or even quite
inert, when administered in their solid or liquid state,
exert a very rapid and energetic operation when
they are presented to the human body in the attenuated
form of vapour. This fact is well illustrated by
the subtlety and activity of metallic mercury <em>in the
state of vapour</em>; a substance which, according to the
highest authorities, is quite inactive when introduced
in its grosser form into the stomach. It is thus that
the workmen employed in gilding, silvering looking-glasses,
constructing barometers, &amp;c. experience such
dreadful effects; that such effects arise from the <i>metal</i>
in a state of vapour, and not, as some have supposed,
from the <i>oxide</i>,<a id='r500' /><a href='#f500' class='c011'><sup>[500]</sup></a> is a fact capable of demonstration, for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_459'>459</span>the artists at Birmingham affix an apparatus in their
chimneys as a system of economy, in order to collect
the mercury, which is always found in its <i>metallic</i>
state.<a id='r501' /><a href='#f501' class='c011'><sup>[501]</sup></a> From the late interesting experiments of
<i>Mr. Faraday</i>,<a id='r502' /><a href='#f502' class='c011'><sup>[502]</sup></a> it appears that <i>mercury</i> rises in vapour
at the ordinary temperature of the atmosphere;
the knowledge of which fact will afford a very satisfactory
explanation of several phenomena, which
were previously unintelligible. <i>Dr. Hermbstaed</i>, in
the memoir, above mentioned, “on the volatility of
substances hitherto considered as fixed bodies,” relates
the following curious fact with regard to the
volatility of mercury. “At the Royal Manufactory
of looking-glasses in Berlin, during a severe winter,
the artificers who worked in a room, which had originally
served for the process of <i>silvering</i> the glasses,
lighted a fire, and thus heated the apartment to between
86° and 96° <i>Fah.</i> In a few days the whole of them
were, to their great surprise, affected by a strong salivation,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_460'>460</span>as there was no trace of mercury in, or near
the room. They consulted on the subject, and suspecting
the real cause of the event, had the flooring
of the room taken up, when about 40 lbs of the metal
were found spread about in different parts, where it
had fallen at various times during the operation of
silvering, which had been executed in that room before.”
With such facts before us, we shall no longer
be unable to explain the effects which were produced
on board his majesty’s ship <i>Triumph</i>, off Cadiz, in
April 1809, by the bursting of leathern bags containing
quicksilver, and the consequent dispersion of
not less than three tons of the metal through the vessel.
The interest excited by this case has been very
great, and as the facts, involved in its history, are of
high medical importance, we were induced to apply
for permission to search the journals of the ship; and,
through the kindness of <i>Dr. Burnett</i>, one of his majesty’s
commissioners for victualling the navy, and
the assistance of <i>Mr. Plowman</i>, who held the situation
of surgeon to the <i>Triumph</i>, we have been enabled
to obtain a correct and detailed history of the
event. Previous to the circumstances we are about to
describe, “the ship’s company had been tolerably
healthy, when unfortunately a quantity of quicksilver
was received on board, and diffused over the ship in
consequence of the bursting of the leathern bags, in
which it had been enclosed; when its effects were
soon displayed upon the crew, by occasioning ptyalism,
partial paralysis, affections of the bowels; so
that in three weeks, no less than two hundred men
were in a state of salivation. In consequence of
which two transports were taken up as hospital ships,
in which the slighter cases soon recovered; but as many
fresh cases occurred daily, <i>Vice-Admiral Pickmore</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_461'>461</span>ordered a survey on the ship, and ship’s company, by
the surgeons of the squadron, on the third of May,
who reported the necessity of sending the ship into
port, in order to clear her hold, change part of her
provisions, into which the quicksilver had insinuated
itself, and to purify her by means of ablution. This
was accordingly done; but on stowing the hold
afresh, every man so employed, as well as those engaged
in the steward’s room, were attacked with
ptyalism. Fresh cases happened daily, until they
took their departure from Cadiz on the 13th of June;
after which but few occurred, which was attributed
by the surgeon to the coldness of the weather, the
fresh breezes from the north-east, from the men having
been kept constantly on deck, and not allowed to
sleep on the orlop, and from not suffering those affected
with ptyalism to lie on the lower deck; as
well as from the constant attention paid in the ventilation
of the ship by means of wind-sails. But, notwithstanding
all these precautions, the ship had
not been more than ten days at sea, when many
of the men became worse, and it was found necessary
to send twenty-four seamen on board the <i>Goshawk</i>,
and two transports. On the arrival of the
<i>Triumph</i> in Cawsand Bay, on the 5th of July, there
did not remain one case of ptyalism on their list.
During this extraordinary visitation two men died
from excessive ptyalism, one of them at Cadiz, having
previously lost his teeth, and both cheeks at the
time of his decease being in a state of sphacelation;
the other, who died at Gibraltar, had lost the whole
of his teeth, two-thirds of his tongue, and, at the
time of his death, the lower lip was in a state of gangrene.
To the interesting facts above related, <i>Mr.
Plowman</i> adds, that the interior of the ship was covered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_462'>462</span>with a black powder, and that the copper bolts
displayed the mercurial influence. The mercurial
vapours proved fatal to the living stock on board, for
nearly all the poultry, sheep, pigs, mice,<a id='r503' /><a href='#f503' class='c011'><sup>[503]</sup></a> goats,
cats, a dog, and even a canary bird, died from its
influence.”</p>

<h5 class='c016'><span class='sc'>Sulphuretted Hydrogen Gas.</span></h5>

<p class='c014'>This gas is transparent and colourless; it has the
property of inflammability, and when set on fire in
the open air, burns with a bluish flame, and deposits
a certain portion of sulphur. It is distinguished by
an excessively fœtid smell, which has been aptly compared
to that of rotten eggs. Its habitudes with
other gases are interesting and important; by admixture
with <i>chlorine</i>, it immediately undergoes decomposition,
yielding its hydrogen, so as to form <i>hydro-chloric
acid</i> (<i>muriatic acid</i>), and consequently depositing
its sulphur; with <i>ammoniacal gas</i> it combines,
and forms an <i>hydro-sulphuret of ammonia</i>; when
mingled with <i>sulphurous acid gas</i>, the hydrogen of
the former combines with the oxygen of the latter,
and the sulphur of both is precipitated; when passed
over ignited charcoal it is converted into carburetted
hydrogen gas, and sulphur is deposited.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is soluble in water, and the solution precipitates
the different metals from their saline solutions, in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_463'>463</span>form of sulphurets; a property which at once distinguishes
this gas from every other.</p>

<p class='c000'>It has been long considered a very energetic poison,
and it would, at the same time, appear to be a very
insidious one; for sensibility is quickly destroyed by
it, without any previous suffering. We are acquainted
with a chemist who was suddenly deprived of
sense, as he stood over a pneumatic trough, in which
he was collecting the gas. It would seem to act upon
the nervous system through the medium of the blood, in
which it is extremely soluble. It constitutes the particular
gas of privies, and is the immediate cause of
those accidents which we have already described in a
former part of this work, <i>vol.</i> 1, <i>page</i> 100; since the
printing of which we have heard of the death of four
persons from emptying a privy at Brompton. This
gas will be sometimes developed during the imperfect
combustion of wet coals<a id='r504' /><a href='#f504' class='c011'><sup>[504]</sup></a>; and it was probably
owing to its presence, or to that of <i>carburetted hydrogen</i>,
that the accident arose which is recorded
by <i>Mr. Sutleffe</i> in the <cite>Medical Repository</cite>. “He
was hastily summoned to a neighbouring family
at bed-time, where he found a female domestic labouring
under a shrill, laborious inspiration; she
had taken up from a good kitchen fire, a panful of
live coals, from which a sudden suffocating blast
seized her.”</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_464'>464</span>
  <h5 class='c016'><span class='sc'>Carburetted Hydrogen Gas.</span></h5>
</div>

<p class='c014'>This gas is developed by several chemical processes.
We have just stated that if, during the
burning of charcoal, moisture be present, it is evolved
in abundance. It appears to be particularly fatal
to animal life. <i>Dr. Beddoes</i> made many experiments
upon the subject, from which it would seem to destroy
life by rendering the muscular fibre inirritable
without producing any previous excitement. In
order to decide this question, <i>Sir Humphry Davy</i><a id='r505' /><a href='#f505' class='c011'><sup>[505]</sup></a>
ventured to take three inspirations of the gas produced
from the decomposition of water by charcoal.
“The first inspiration produced a sort of numbness
and loss of feeling in the chest, and about the pectoral
muscles; after the second,” says he, “I lost all
power of perceiving external things, and had no distinct
sensation, except a terrible oppression on the
chest; during the third expiration, this feeling disappeared;
I seemed sinking into annihilation, and
had just power enough to drop the mouth-piece from
my unclosed lips. There is every reason to believe,
that if I had taken four or five inspirations, instead of
three, they would have destroyed life immediately,
without producing any painful sensation.”</p>

<h5 class='c016'><span class='sc'>Chlorine</span>—<i>Oxy-muriatic Acid Gas</i>.</h5>

<p class='c014'>This gas, which is now considered as an elementary
body, has received from <i>Sir Humphry Davy</i> the
name of <i>chlorine</i>, from the green colour which characterises
<span class='pageno' id='Page_465'>465</span>it. Its odour is so penetrating and insupportable
that it is impossible to respire it, even when
considerably diluted with atmospheric air, and yet it
will support combustion. It discharges vegetable
colours, whence it forms the basis of various bleaching
preparations. According to the experiments<a id='r506' /><a href='#f506' class='c011'><sup>[506]</sup></a>
of <i>M. Nysten</i>, this gas is not absorbed when respired
pure, but appears to act only by irritating the bronchiæ
locally; and so energetic is its action, that the
animal dies before there is sufficient time for asphyxia
to take place from the circulation of black blood.
When it is respired in a dilute form, it produces a
severe cough, and, according to <i>Fourcroy</i>, it occasions
a phlegmonic inflammation of the bronchial
membranes. The death of the ingenious and indefatigable
<i>Pelletier</i> was occasioned by his accidentally
inhaling a proportion of this gas; a consumption
was the consequence, which in a short time proved
fatal. In the <cite>London Medical and Physical Journal
for November, 1821</cite>, a case of a person is recorded
who was poisoned by bleaching liquor.</p>

<h5 class='c016'><span class='sc'>Sulphurous Acid Gas.</span></h5>

<p class='c014'>The gas is generated by the combustion of sulphur.
It is colourless; has a pungent smell, resembling
that of burning sulphur, and is very soluble in water.
It would appear to destroy life by a peculiar action
on the blood.</p>

  <h2 id='c14' class='c008'>OF HOMICIDE BY MISADVENTURE OR ACCIDENT.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>If a physician gives a person a potion without any
intent of doing him any bodily hurt, but with an intent
to cure or prevent a disease, and contrary to the
expectation of the physician it kills him, this is no
(culpable) homicide, and the like of a chirurgeon;
<i>1 Hale</i>, <i>P. C.</i> 429; <i>4 Bl. Comm.</i> 197. But query if
he were not a regular physician or surgeon? on this
there appears to be some difference of opinion; it was
anciently holden that if one, that is not of the mystery
of a physician or surgeon, take upon him the
cure of a man, and he dieth of the potion or medicine,
this is covert felony. <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Si un que nest physition
ou surgeon emprent sur luy un cure, que murrust in
sa main, que cest felonie</span></i>; <cite>Stanford’s Pleas of the
Crown</cite>, <i>cap.</i> 9; <i>Fitzherbert</i>, <i>tit. coron.</i> <i>p.</i> 311; <i>Briton</i>,
<i>fol.</i> 14; <i>Lombard</i>, <i>Eiren. tit. Felonie</i> saith thus; that
<i>Thorpe</i>, <i>43 Ed. 3</i>, 33, saith he knew one to be indicted
accordingly. <i>Dalton</i>, <i>p.</i> 470, queries this case,
as it is difficult to determine the actual cause of
death, and there appeareth no will to do harm, but
rather to do good, and “the <i>34 Hen. 8</i>, <i>c.</i> 8, leaveth
so great a liberty of such practice to unskilful persons,
that it will be hard now to make it felony.” Now
the statute of <i>Henry the eighth</i> applies only to the
cure of certain diseases or sores, particularly specified,
and others like to the same, by external applications,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_467'>467</span>and to drinks for the stone, strangury, or
agues, provided (if the preamble may be relied on)
“the said persons have not taken any thing for their
pains or cunning, but have ministered the same to the
poor people only, for neighbourhood, and God’s sake,
and of pity, and charity;” in such sense the act is reasonable
even to this day, much more then, when from
the scarcity of regular practitioners, the charitable
in the country were frequently called upon to administer
on emergencies, where no medical aid could be
procured; but surely this act can never have been
intended to warrant the administration of dangerous
medicines, arsenic, corrosive sublimate, or cantharides,
such indeed as may be fairly classed as absolute
poisons, except when in skilful hands, nor the
performance of surgical operations. <i>Dalton</i> indeed
adds “But if a smith or other person (having skill
only in dressing or curing the diseases of horses or
other cattle) shall take upon him the cutting, or
letting blood, or such like cure of a man, who
dieth thereof, this seemeth to be felony; for the
rule is, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">quod quisque norit, in hoc se (non) exerceat</span></i>.”
And if it were otherwise, great evils might arise; for
persons intending to commit murders, need only cover
their design by a pretence of administering medicine;<a id='r507' /><a href='#f507' class='c011'><sup>[507]</sup></a>
thus in <i>Vaux’s</i> case, the professed purpose
of administering the cantharides, was not illegal, yet
the prisoner was found guilty of murder. In <i>Donellan’s</i>
case, what would a plea have availed, that the
chemical principle of laurel water was, in the prisoner’s
opinion, a cure for consumption, with which <i>Sir
<span class='pageno' id='Page_468'>468</span>Theodosius Boughton</i> was threatened, and that it had
been administered to cure, and not to kill him; or
on the death of <i>Mr. Scawen</i>,<a id='r508' /><a href='#f508' class='c011'><sup>[508]</sup></a> that his mistress had
infused or dissolved corrosive sublimate in all his
drinks and medicines, to cure him of an ulcer, with
which he was afflicted; and that she had done it
secretly, because he had an avowed aversion to mercurial
medicines. Yet such pleas would continually
be made, if the doctrine of allowing all persons however
ignorant and unqualified to tamper with medicines,
should be admitted. On the other hand there
is very considerable weight of authority; <i>Sir. Wm.
Blackstone</i> follows <i>Sir Mathew Hale</i> in his opinion,
that this doctrine, that if any die under the hand of an
unlicenced physician it is felony, is apocryphal, and
fitted to gratify and flatter doctors and licentiates in
physic; though it may have its use to make people
cautious, and wary, how they take upon themselves
too much in this dangerous employment; <i>1 Hales</i>,
<i>P. C.</i> 429, 430; <i>4 Bl. Com.</i> <i>c.</i> 14, <i>p.</i> 197; it is difficult
to imagine how caution is to be enforced by taking
away the liability to punishment. Mr. Serjeant
<i>Hawkins</i> takes a different ground; “Also it hath
been anciently holden, that if a person, not duly
authorised to be a physician or surgeon, undertake
a cure and the patient die under his hand, he is
guilty of felony;” but inasmuch as the books
wherein this opinion is holden (<i>Stamford</i>, <i>P. C.</i> 16;
<i>Pulton</i>, 22; <i>Crom.</i> 27; <i>43 Ed. 3</i>, 33; <i>Fitz H. Cor.</i>
163; <i>Britt.</i> <i>c.</i> 5; and <i>4 Inst.</i> 251) were written before
the statutes of <i>23 Hen. 8</i>, which first excluded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_469'>469</span>such felonious killing, as may be called wilful murder
of malice prepense, from the benefit of clergy, it may
be well questioned whether such killing shall be said
to be of malice prepense within the intent of that
statute; however it is certainly highly rash and presumptuous
for unskilful persons to undertake matters
of this nature; “<em>and indeed the law cannot be too severe
in this case</em>, in order to deter ignorant people
from endeavouring <em>to get a livelihood</em> by such practice,
which cannot be followed without the manifest
hazard of the lives of those who have to do
with them;” <i>1 Hawk. P. C.</i> 131. This doctrine
does not by any means go as far as <i>Sir Mathew Hale</i>;
for as the supposed alteration of the law is referred
to the operation of the statute, which takes away
the benefit of clergy from murders, that is to say
from felonious killing with malice prepense, it does not
apply to manslaughter, to which the benefit of clergy
was still allowed. But there yet remains a question,
whether in the case of a person illegally taking
upon himself the administration of dangerous medicines,
for profit, (and it must be observed that the
greater number of nostrums are, from the powerful
nature of their ingredients, highly dangerous) does
not subject himself to a charge of murder if any die
under his hands; for “if a man does such an act, of
which the probable consequence may be, and
eventually is, death, such killing may be murder,
although no stroke is struck;” <i>4 Bl. Com.</i> 197.
What then if a man for profit administer dangerous
preparations of mercury to persons necessarily exposed
to change of temperature, and inclemency of
weather; nay, delusively hold out to them, that no
mercury is employed, by which they are induced to
neglect the most ordinary precautions; if death ensue
<span class='pageno' id='Page_470'>470</span>is not this equally murder, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">in foro conscientiæ</span></i>, as
killing with the sword? Malice may be implied in
law, as well as apparent; it may be general, as well
as particular; and whenever a man has evinced, whether
from avarice, cruelty, or wantonness, such disregard
for the lives and safeties of mankind, as warrants
the imputation of general malice, it is not necessary
that individual malice be proved towards the
party who has become his victim.<a id='r509' /><a href='#f509' class='c011'><sup>[509]</sup></a> <i>1 Easts. P. C.</i>
231. “So too if a man hath a beast that is used to
do mischief, and he knowing it, suffers it to go
abroad, and it kills a man, even this is manslaughter
in the owner: but if he had purposely <em>turned it
loose</em>, though barely to frighten people, and make
what is called sport, it is with us (as in the Jewish
law) as much murder as if he had incited a bear or
dog to worry them;” <i>4 Bl. Com.</i> 197. And <i>Hale</i>
says, <i>1 P. C.</i> 431, I have heard that the owner was
hanged for it. Is there much difference, whether the
mischief be done by a dangerous beast, or a poisonous
drug? to us it appears that the man who vends or
administers the one, is as guilty as he who is convicted
of turning out the other. If <i>A</i> give purging comfits
to <i>B</i> to make sport and not to hurt him, and <i>B</i>
dies thereof, it is a killing by <i>A</i>, but not murder,
but manslaughter; 1, <i>II. P. C.</i> 431; <i>Dalt.</i> <i>cap.</i> 93.
Here <i>A</i> is not supposed cognisant of the dangerous
nature of the comfits.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_471'>471</span>With every deference therefore to the very high
authorities, which have supported a contrary opinion,
we cannot but conclude, that the unlawful administration
of medicine for profit, by which death
ensues, may constitute wilful murder in some cases,
manslaughter in most, and a high misdemeanor in
all, according to the quantity of general malice, ignorance,
and presumption, evidenced in each case;
under what class each individual instance may fall, is
a proper subject for a jury. If the law be defective
on this point it cannot be too soon amended, and we
must express our sanguine hope, that the consideration
of revenue, as arising from the stamp duties on
patent medicines, will not be allowed to influence the
legislature in a matter vitally important to the public
health, and to the lives of his majesty’s subjects, more
especially as the evil principally operates on the
class, whose personal vigour constitutes the strength
and sinews of the country. And yet in candour we
must admit the difficulties and embarrassments with
which the subject is beset: the multiplication of restraints
in a free country is very naturally regarded
with extreme jealousy, and however anxiously we
may desire to crush those harpies of society, who
scatter poison and death around, under the pretence
of affording relief, yet the object must not be purchased
by the infringement of civil liberty.</p>

<p class='c000'>Doctor <i>Goodall</i>, in his historical account of the
college’s proceedings against empiricks, published in
1684, mentions many cases in which death has ensued
from unlawful administration of medicine; in some
of these cases, the college punished the offenders
according to their jurisdiction; some by fine and imprisonment,
for mala praxis; others they sued at
law, for the penalty of five pounds per month for unlicensed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_472'>472</span>practice. But in those instances which appeared
to require greater severity of punishment,
they consigned the accused to the ordinary course of
justice. See <i>Humphrey Beven’s</i> case, <i>Goodall’s Pro.</i>
425—<i>John Hope’s</i> case, for giving two apples of coloquintida
to a man as a purge, of which he died.

</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f18'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r18'>18</a>. A question has arisen, says <i>Mr. Brodie</i>, (<cite>Manuscript Notes</cite>) whether
the whole of the brain is essential to the function of respiration,
or whether the power of calling the respiratory muscles into action may
not reside in some particular part of that organ? It has been stated by
<i>Le Gallois</i> that if you expose the cavity of the cranium, and remove the
upper part of the brain, the muscles of respiration continue to act as
usual; if, however, the dissection be continued, as soon as that portion
of the <i>Medulla Oblongata</i> is removed which corresponds to the <i>Corpora
Olivaria</i>, their action is immediately suspended. The theory which such
an experiment naturally establishes has received no inconsiderable support
from the history of a fœtus, published by <i>Mr. Lawrence</i> in the Medico
Chirurgical Transactions: in this monster the <i>Cerebrum</i> and <i>Cerebellum</i>
were entirely absent, but the <i>Medulla Spinalis</i> was continued for about
an inch above the <i>Foramen Magnum</i> of the occiput, so as to form an imperfect
<i>Medulla Oblongata</i>, and to give origin to several nerves. Death
did not take place immediately after birth, as in other instances of cerebral
deficiency, but the child breathed for four days after it had been
expelled from the uterus.</p>
</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f19'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r19'>19</a>. <i>Lower</i>, as early as the year 1667, shewed that if the nerves which

<p class='c000'><a href='#r20'>20</a>. While this work was in progress we have read an account of a
person who, being in a state of debility, died suddenly from the shock
of a shower bath at Brighton. In this case Syncope was probably occasioned
in the same manner as by a blow on the head.</p>
</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f21'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r21'>21</a>. <i>Trance.</i> Although this term is extremely familiar, it does not appear
that any precise meaning is attached to it; the popular notion is
that the body may for a time be abandoned by the soul, and remain for
a certain period in a deep sleep, during which the exercise of the vital
functions is so obscure, that the individual is reduced to a state of close
simulation of death.</p>
</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f22'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r22'>22</a>. A great question has arisen upon this subject, whether rupture
of the heart ever takes place in the sound state of that organ? And it
has been answered by several pathologists in the affirmative. Fischer’s
case from the <span class='sc'>Journal der Practischen Heilkunde</span>, may be seen in
the <span class='sc'>Medical Repository</span>, Vol. 11, p. 427, and Vol. 12, p. 164.
<span class='sc'>Harvey</span> found in a male subject a rupture in the aortic ventricle,
capable of admitting a finger, and remarked that the parietes of the
cavity possessed their natural strength and thickness (Exercitat III.
De Circulo Sanguinis, T. p. 1. 281.) <span class='sc'>Bohn</span> also gives a case of a man
who had died suddenly, when a fissure was discovered in the <i>Ostium
Aortæ</i>. <span class='sc'>Portal</span> has informed us, that in a rupture of the basis of the
heart, which he examined, the structure of the organ was as firm and
compact as in the natural state, and that in another case the parietes of
the heart displayed their natural solidity. (Memoires de l’Academie
des Sciences, a Paris, 1784, p. 51.) <span class='sc'>Soemering</span> considers it as having
been very correctly remarked by Portal, that the Aortic ventricle
commonly bursts without any previous weakening of the substance of
the heart. (See Soemering’s German Translation of Baillie’s Morbid
Anatomy, with Additions.) <span class='sc'>Dr. Whytt</span> has likewise seen the heart
burst from protracted grief, and therefore does not regard the term,
“<span class='fss'>BROKEN HEART</span>,” in the light of a mere metaphor. On the contrary,
<span class='sc'>Boerhaave</span> has recorded two cases, and believes that the rupture was
occasioned by the morbid accumulation of fat; <span class='sc'>Kreysig</span> suspects that
in most of these cases of ruptured heart an insidious inflammation had
been established, and he considers that the quantity of adipose substance
in which ruptured hearts are so commonly found enveloped, furnishes
an evidence of this inflammatory state (Sopra i Malattée del cuore.)
We are decidedly of opinion that such ruptures take place in consequence
of a morbid state of the heart capable of diminishing the cohesive
power of its fibres. See a Treatise on the Diseases of the Chest by <i>R.
T. H. Laennec, M. D.</i> translated by <i>J. Forbes, M. D.</i> London, 1821.</p>

<p class='c000'><a href='#r25'>25</a>. A young animal may not so soon perish as an older one; and a
strong and healthy individual may survive during a longer period than
a creature that is in a state of debility. By filling the lungs with air a
person may also be enabled to dispense with the act of respiration for a
longer period; <i>Mr. Kite</i> made a very deep inspiration of 300 cubic
inches, and was thus enabled to retain this quantity for 72 seconds,
without a fresh inspiration; and divers in the pearl fisheries, inspire
deeply before they descend. It has been, moreover, established by
numerous experiments that the demand for oxygen in the lungs is materially
influenced by the nature of the ingesta received into the stomach;
<i>Mr. Spalding</i>, the celebrated diver, observed, that whenever he used a
diet of animal food, or drank spirituous liquors, he consumed in a much
shorter time the oxygen of the atmospheric air in his diving-bell; and
therefore he had learned from experience to confine himself to a vegetable
diet, and water, when following his avocation. And the priest,
or conjurer (<i>Pillal Karras</i>, in the Malabar language) who attends the
divers in the pearl fisheries of the east, enjoins, as a religious duty, an
abstinence from all food, before he plunges into the ocean.</p>

<p class='c000'>Muscular exertions, as in the act of struggling, will without doubt contribute
to the expenditure of oxygen, and increase the demand for it, and
therefore in its absence such movement must accelerate death by suffocation;
this physiological fact will be hereafter more fully elucidated.</p>
</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f26'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r26'>26</a>. We anticipate the objections that will be urged against the truth
of this assertion. It will be asked how it can be reconciled with the accounts
of persons who have recovered after an asphyxia of a much
longer duration? It may be inquired how the statement can be reconciled
with the ordinary histories of divers, who have become so expert
in the art which they profess, as to be capable of remaining beneath the
water for twenty minutes, or even for a longer period: we are bound
to consider such statements as no better than extravagant fables; not
more authentic, says <i>Mr. Brodie</i> (Manuscript Notes), but certainly less
poetical and elegant, than those of the nymphs and mermaids, whose ordinary
residence is in grottos beneath the waves of the sea; or than
those Arabian fictions which have amused and astonished our youthful
imaginations with the description of the Princes who govern the submarine
nations, and pass their lives in palaces of crystal at the bottom of
the ocean—but of this we shall speak more fully hereafter.</p>
</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f27'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r27'>27</a>. Although the term <span class='sc'>Asphyxia</span> merely signifies the absence of the
pulse, yet the name is erroneously applied to every apparent loss of vitality.</p>
</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f28'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r28'>28</a>. <span class='sc'>De Haen</span> thought that death was produced in drowning by the
water flowing into the lungs, and thus stopping the passage of the blood
in the arteries. This belief gave origin to the very erroneous and mischievous
practice, which still continues amongst the more ignorant, of
suspending drowned persons by the heels, or of rolling them over barrels.</p>
</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f29'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r29'>29</a>. <i>Mr. Coleman</i> examined the lungs of a cat which had been drowned,
by placing a ligature on the trachea, removing the lungs from the
thorax, and then making an opening in the trachea under water, so as
to collect the air which issued from the orifice; the whole quantity of
air thus obtained, amounted only to half a drachm; yet the same lungs
when inflated, required as much as two ounces of air, by measure, for
their distention. Nor would the presence of water appear to be immediately
fatal, when introduced into the lungs; Dr. <i>Goodwyn</i> poured two
ounces of water into the lungs of a cat, through an opening made between
the cartilages of the trachea; the animal had an immediate difficulty
of breathing, and a feeble pulse, but lived several hours afterwards
without much apparent inconvenience; it was at length strangled,
and the water was found in the lungs. From which it would appear,
that the admission of a certain portion of water, does not tend
to hasten death. The author of this note was present at an experiment
made by Mr. <i>Brodie</i>, in which he drowned a guinea pig, whose trachea
had been previously perforated; so that in this case, no spasm of the
glottis could arrest the ingress of the water into the pulmonary air
cells; but this produced no modification of the usual symptoms; nor
did it prevent the resuscitation of the animal, which was afterwards
effected by the appropriate methods.</p>
</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f30'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r30'>30</a>. An animal also dies sooner by drowning, than by simple strangulation;
Mr. <i>Brodie</i> considers that the abstraction of heat in the former
case is quite sufficient to account for this difference.</p>

<p class='c000'><a href='#r47'>47</a>. In consequence of plants, in the absence of the sun, giving off nitrogen
and carbonic acid gases, the custom of sleeping with flowers in the
bed chamber is deleterious, and may even, under certain circumstances
prove fatal; a melancholy proof of this occurred in October, 1814, at
Leighton-Buzzard, in Bedfordshire. “<i>Mr. Sherbrook</i> having frequently
had his pinery robbed, the gardener determined to sit up and watch.
He accordingly posted himself with a loaded fowling piece, in the
green-house, where it is supposed he fell asleep, and in the morning
was found dead upon the ground, with all the appearance of suffocation,
evidently occasioned by the discharge of <i>Mephitic</i> gas from the
plants during the night.” <cite>Observer</cite> of 16th, and <cite>Times</cite> of 17th October,

<p class='c000'><a href='#r48'>48</a>. <i>Rozier</i> and <i>Sir Humphrey Davy</i> conclude from their experiments
that carbonic acid kills by exciting a spasmodic action, in which the
epiglottis is closed, and the entrance of this fluid into the lungs altogether
prevented. <i>Dr. Babington</i> appears to entertain a different opinion,
(see “a case of exposure to the vapour of burning charcoal,”
Medico-Chirurg. Trans. vol. 1, p. 83,) and asks how we shall explain
the fact, that the loss of irritability in the muscles of animals which have
been destroyed by immersion in noxious airs, is comparatively greater
than in such as are hanged or drowned, unless we suppose that the carbonic
acid exerts a deleterious influence on the nervous and muscular
systems? The farther consideration of this subject will be more properly
entertained under the head of poisons.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f49'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r49'>49</a>. Comparative anatomy would furnish us with a variety of beautiful
arguments, if it were necessary, to support these views. The bird
whose muscular exertion is so great during its flight, is provided with a
more than ordinary extent of pulmonary apparatus; and amongst insects
we find that many of the <i>coleopterous</i> species disclose avenues of air,
in the act of flying, which, in their quiet state, are closed by the cases
of their wings, thus procuring for themselves a larger supply of oxygen,
at a period when from their exertions they most require it. Flat fish
who, having no swimming bladder, remain at the bottom, and possess
but little velocity, have gills that are quite concealed, while those who
encounter a rude and boisterous stream, as trout, perch, or salmon,
have them widely expanded. For further observations upon this subject,
the author begs to refer to his paper in the 10th vol. of the Linnean
Transactions, entitled “On the Physiology of the Egg,” by <i>J. A. Paris,

on prisoners who stood mute out of malice, or who feigned themselves
mad, or challenged peremptorily more than the number of Jurors
allowed by law, thus refusing their legal trial. “The manner of inflicting
this punishment may be best found from the Books of Entries and
other law books, all of which generally agree, that the prisoner shall
be remanded to the place from whence he came, and put into some
low dark room, and there laid on his back without any manner of
covering, except for the privy parts, and that as many weights be laid
upon him as he can bear and more, and that he shall have no manner
of sustenance but the worst bread and water, and that he shall not eat
the same day in which he drinks, nor drink the same day on which he
eats, and that he shall so continue till he die.” Some authorities say
till he answers. See 2 <i>Hawk. P. C.</i> 330. <i>c.</i> 30. § 16. 4 <i>Bl. Com.</i> <i>p.</i> 319.

remains “as a monument of the savage rapacity with which the lordly
tyrants of feudal antiquity hunted after escheats and forfeitures,” for
when the criminal died mute, the lord in some cases lost his escheat;
(see 4 <i>Bl. Com.</i> 323). But its execution is no longer permitted by our
laws. By Stat. 12 <i>Geo.</i> 3. c. 20, sentence may be passed on those who
stand mute as if they had been found or pleaded guilty.</p>

is computed by the number of ideas that pass through the mind; whenever
an event occurs which powerfully excites the attention of an observer,
he watches the most minute change, whence he believes that the
time which elapses before the whole event is completed, appears to be
unusually prolonged. When the infidel sultan of Egypt refused to believe
that Mahomet could have ascended into the seven heavens, and have
held some thousand conferences with the Almighty in the space of a few
minutes, the learned mussulman, who was consulted on the occasion,
endeavoured to turn his Majesty to a more strict faith, by demonstrating
to him that a short period of time became converted into a long one,
when a great multitude of important events were crouded into it.</p>

<p class='c000'><a href='#r68'>68</a>. In a tract entitled “Observations on Animal Life and Apparent
Death, by <i>John Franks</i>, surgeon, 8vo. London, 1790,” the author says
that “when the late <i>Mr. Justamond</i> (Surgeon to the Middlesex hospital)
lived on the terrace, Palace yard, Westminster, a boy who had been
drowned in the Thames was brought to him; he made an opening into
the wind-pipe, in order to inflate the lungs; but the discharge of blood
which ensued was such as gave him no chance of succeeding in the recovery;
for he could not prevent the blood from pouring down into the
lungs.” Although, says <i>Dr. Currie</i>, nothing is said in this case about
the pulse, yet from the blood flowing so copiously, there is reason to
believe that the heart had begun to act; and therefore to conclude, that
life was in fact <em>destroyed</em> by this operation, which <em>might</em> have been saved
without it. See “Observations on Apparent Death from Drowning,

person against whom the judgment of the Court has been executed,

and it is likewise held, that the marriage is dissolved by the execution
of the convicted party. <i>Margaret Dickson</i> then, having been convicted

her no farther, but he filed a bill in the high court of Judiciary against

<p class='c000'><a href='#r76'>76</a>. Except in case of persons dying in jail, the Coroner must not hold
unnecessary inquests on the bodies of those who have died in the ordinary
course of nature. “And the Court of King’s Bench, on two
several occasions within my own memory, blamed the Coroners of
Norfolk and Anglesea, for holding repeated and unnecessary inquests,
for the sake of enhancing their fees, on bodies and parts of bodies
which were cast up by the sea shore, without the smallest probability
or suspicion of the deaths happening in any other manner than by the
unfortunate perils of the sea.” 1 <i>East. P.C.</i> 382. See <i>ib.</i> the case of

<p class='c000'><a href='#r78'>78</a>. But this power should be used with discretion. On a late occasion,
the Judge severely reprobated the conduct of a magistrate, who
had committed a poor lad to await the assizes, in company of notorious

witness of a felony, and was too poor to find recognizance.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f80'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r80'>80</a>. “It is true that the statute does in terms only require the coroner
to put in writing <em>the effect</em> of the evidence. But this must not be taken
to give him a latitude, such as hath been but too often taken by persons
of this description to the great perversion of truth and justice, of
putting down, not the words of the witnesses, but his own conception
of their tendency. It is doubtless the meaning of the act, that the examination
of the witnesses should be taken down with the greatest
possible accuracy as to all material points of the inquiry: otherwise
one great benefit of the act, which is to enable the Court to compare
the examination with the evidence, must be defeated. <em>The effect</em> mentioned
therein, means the true and genuine sense of the evidence, as
delivered in detail, not indeed in letters, syllables, or even words;
though these should not be needlessly departed from; but the fair and
obvious meaning of the words spoken, and not the final result of the
evidence. Complaints have in my own memory been made by judges
on the circuits of the culpable neglect of coroners in this respect, and
threats of exemplary punishment holden out to them, to prevent a
repetition of the same abuse in future.” 1 <i>East. P.C.</i> 384.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was evidently the original intention of the Legislature, that the
coroner should view the body on the spot where it was found; that he
and his jury might judge as well by inspection of the body, as by an
examination of surrounding objects, whether the deceased had died by
violence. And Sir <i>William Blackstone</i> says, “He must also sit at the
<em>very</em> place where the death happened,” 1 <i>Com.</i> 348. and this should
certainly be done in all possible cases, for the state of surrounding
objects most frequently will testify more strongly than any other evidence.
Modern fastidiousness has introduced the custom of removing
the body to some public-house, even where the death had happened in
an ordinary dwelling; this if not illegal, is at least improper.</p>

crime was murder, but they refused to find any other verdict than
<i>Accidental death</i>; which verdict the coroner recorded, and then by his
warrant sent <i>Scorey</i> to the county goal for murder.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Scorey</i> being now brought up by Habeas Corpus—The Court, on full

<p class='c000'><a href='#r86'>86</a>. There are many cases in which there is no substance which can
be made the subject of deodand; as in death by poison or by explosions
in mines, either from inflammable gas, or the powder used in blasting.
The first of these cases calls for immediate remedy; as the instances of
fatal substitution of poison for medicine occur continually, notwithstanding
the repeated warnings published on the subject. Nor are
accidents in mines less worthy of attention; ordinary precaution might
have prevented many which have lately taken place. The Safety lamp
of Sir <i>H. Davy</i> is so firmly established in reputation, that no doubts
can be entertained of its efficacy; some late inventions also have secured
the miner from the numerous disasters to which he is liable in
the dangerous operation of blasting. When the conductors of mines
neglect these ordinary and well-known precautions, they become morally
responsible for any mischief which may consequently occur; we
have only to lament that they are not legally answerable for their
criminal neglect.</p>

<p class='c000'><a href='#r88'>88</a>. It is not for us in this place to argue the question whether excessive
severity of punishment does or does not defeat its punishment; as
more injury is done by inducing that illegal mercy which is here complained
of, than benefit is derived by terror of the unexecuted sentence
of the law: the subject is in abler hands; we shall, therefore, content
ourselves with suggesting, that coroners should be far more strict in
their examination of the bodies of persons supposed to be <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">felo de se</span></i>; nay,
that anatomical inspection of the great cavities should be absolutely required
in all cases. We will not maintain with a French author on Medical
Jurisprudence, that the signs of insanity can often be discovered
on dissection; though we can imagine some cases, as where there has
been an excessive determination of blood to the brain, in which this inspection
may be satisfactory; (See vol. 1, p. 327). <i>Fourcroy</i> and <i>Durande</i>
have also found, on dissecting persons who had committed suicide,
hardness of the liver, and gall stones; and <i>Foderé</i> observes that, in failure
of other evidence, such appearances deserve to carry some weight.
But benefit would still result from the practice; first from the general
horror in which dissection is held, for if the dread of an ignominious
burial, however remote the chance of its infliction, can be supposed
to discourage this offence, under the existing law, the certainty of
personal mutilation would operate in the proposed alteration. It is related,
that when suicide had become so frequent among the Roman
ladies, as to threaten ill effects to the commonwealth, the Senate decreed
that the bodies of all who died by their own hands should be exposed
naked in the public ways.</p>

<p class='c000'>The effect of the decree was an immediate cessation of the crime;
possibly the same result might be produced by the dread of dissection.</p>

and it may not be amiss here to observe that the old notion of arresting

<p class='c000'><a href='#r92'>92</a>. It is said that to act upon the mind by terror, continual griefs or
vexations, though with the intent to kill, is not murder, unless there
be some personal violence, 1 <i>East. P. C.</i>, <i>p.</i> 225: but query this, the proof
of the crime may be difficult, but its perpetration is far from impossible.
To act on the mind of a pregnant woman by extreme terrors, and so
produce abortion and death of malice prepense, would certainly be
murder in its most atrocious form; it might require some ingenuity in
framing the indictment; but our law is fertile in fictions on less worthy
occasions, and ought not to allow its just vengeance to be avoided. In
cases of murder by starvation there may be no actual violence, yet the
law reaches this offence; sometimes indeed imprisonment forms a part
of the crime, but this may not always be the case; for if the deceased
were confined to his bed by disease, so that he could not seek his own
food, and those who were bound to supply him maliciously neglected
their duty, it would be murder by omission without any personal
violence committed. <i>See</i> <i>Self’s</i> case, 1 <i>East. P. C.</i> 226: 1 <i>Leach, C.C.</i>
163, and authorities there. So in an indictment for starving a servant,
<i>Lawrence</i>, J. intimated, that he thought the indictment insufficient, in
not alleging <em>that Elizabeth Williams was a girl of tender years, and under
the dominion and controul of the defendant</em>. <i>Rex v. Eliz. Ridley</i>, 2 <i>Camp. R.</i>

<p class='c000'><a href='#r98'>98</a>. It is to be feared that grand juries will discontinue their salutary
custom of visiting the prisons, in consequence of a recent decision that
they have no right to demand admission. As the propriety of their inspection
is generally granted, we may venture to hint a wish that some
enactment may pass on this subject, and that the temporary political
objection, arising out of the seclusion of state prisoners, may not be
permitted to operate as a general and permanent obstacle. It is to the
zeal of individuals in tracing abuses, rather than to legislative enactment
for their prevention, that we look for the still necessary improvements
of our prison discipline; for no government, however vigilant,
can guard against the secret misconduct of its obscurer agents; all it
can do, is to encourage enquiry, whenever the first hint of delinquency
or even of suspicion is communicated. The subject is now under legislative
consideration, and we may therefore hope that a due system may
be adopted, one which shall equally steer clear of the wasteful expenditure
of the Millbank Penitentiary, and the enormities imputed to
Ilchester: that prisons may be made places of confinement, coercion,
and punishment; but not of torture, contagion, and despair.</p>

<p class='c000'>The improvement in morals, order, and cleanliness introduced into
some prisons by the exertions of a benevolent individual (<i>Mrs. Fry</i>)
deserves our notice; her attention indeed has been mainly directed to
the mental and religious instruction of female prisoners, but this mental
improvement is not without its effect on their bodily health; order,
temperance, and cleanliness, will always produce a physical as well as
moral improvement on the minds and persons of the lower orders.</p>

for the (not improbable) contingency of a highly infectious disorder
breaking out in any prison, yet it is evidently unjust that a prisoner for
a debt of <em>one shilling!</em> or any other sum, should be exposed to the hazard
of his life by remaining in contact with the infected, (see <i>Buxton’s</i>
Inquiry.) Formerly the writ of <i>Habeas Corpus</i> was granted on such occasions,
but abuses having arisen it was ultimately referred to the judges
to consider the legality of this application of the writ, who decided
against it; adding, however, that in case of great infection some house
in some good town might be assigned for the warden of the Fleet, and
the like for the marshal of the King’s Bench, where they might keep
their prisoners <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">sub arcta et salva custodia</span></i>. <i>Hutt.</i> 129. But query, how far

<p class='c000'>The suspicion against the prisoner, <i>Charles Angus</i>, was, that he had
endeavoured to procure a premature delivery, or abortion, by means of
an instrument resembling a long trochar, and that he had administered,
or been privy to the administration of certain drugs, which had occasioned
such effects upon the stomach of the deceased, as in the end produced
her death. The prisoner was a retired merchant, with two or
three children, with whom the deceased had lived as housekeeper and
governess. It appeared in evidence that improper familiarities had
been noticed between them, and that Miss <i>Burns</i> had, for some time,
appeared out of health, and that her abdomen was much increased in
size at the period when she was attacked with the symptoms which
preceded her death, and which, as we learn from the witnesses on the
trial, presented the following history.</p>

<p class='c000'>The deceased was seen by the servants of the family at about six
o’clock, on Wednesday morning, the 23d of March, 1808, at which
time she was in her usual state of health; but replied to one of them,
who remarked her having risen earlier than usual, that she could
not sleep. She was next seen by the servants at a quarter before nine,
sitting at breakfast with <i>Mr. Angus</i>, but apparently very ill; after
breakfast she was lying on a sofa complaining of a pain in her bowels,
but she was not then sick. On moving about afterwards, she held by
the chair, as if from pain, and about an hour and a half after breakfast,
she ordered some water gruel, of which she drank nearly three quarts in
the course of the day, being very <a id='thi'></a>thirsty, and in considerable pain, and
so sick as to reject the gruel almost as soon as it was taken. The matter
vomited was described by the house-maid as being, at first, very
black, but becoming, towards the last, of a green colour; the kitchen
maid, however, described it as being in the first instance of a green colour,
<a id='wit'></a>with yellow pieces in it resembling the inside of an orange, or the
yolk of an egg, and as turning blacker after it ceased to be green.
While thus retching, <i>Miss Burns</i> observed to the house-maid, “Oh,
Betty, what bile comes off my stomach! I wish I had taken an emetic
long since.” On the servants going to bed that night, she seemed very
poorly, but did not complain to them.</p>

<p class='c000'>On Thursday morning, at six o’clock, she was lying, as she had been
left the night before, on the sofa, with pillows under her head; she complained
that she was very thirsty; said she was tired of gruel, and had
some water posset, and a little warm beer. She also complained that
she was badly hurt to make water; but was relieved by sitting on a
sliced onion, with some boiling water poured over it. Her vomiting
was now of a blacker colour, and she continued sick and vomiting all
day, till towards evening, when the sickness went off, and she appeared
better, and could stir more about.</p>

<p class='c000'>On Friday morning, at four o’clock, the house-maid went into the
room, and thought her much worse, as she breathed quicker than before.
She was seen again at six in much the same state, and lying in the same
posture on the sofa; she asked for some warm beer, which settled on her
stomach, and she also took about a pint of gruel; she said that the pain
had left her. Her vomiting had ceased, but was succeeded by a “<i>lax</i>,”
which continued all the morning. A little before ten, the house-maid
was sent out for some Madeira, <i>Miss Burns</i> having expressed a wish for
some. Between the hours of ten and eleven, the kitchen maid was in
the room, and received orders about dinner; and <i>Miss Burns</i> said she
would have some barley water. On the return of the house-maid,
about eleven, she went straight into the parlour, where <i>Miss Burns</i> was
found lying dead in the corner, by the door, with her face against the
wall, “<em>cowered of a lump</em>,” her elbows upon her knees, and one foot
“<em>crudled</em>” under her; <i>Mr. Angus</i>, who had nursed her throughout, sitting
in an arm chair, apparently so fast asleep that he was not roused
without difficulty. During the whole course of her illness, she did not
go to bed, but remained in the parlour, generally lying on a sofa. She
refused to have medical assistance; but <i>Mr. Angus</i> said that he had given
her seven drops of laudanum on one night, and ten on another, and
that on the morning of her death he had given her some castor oil, in
spirit, but that it came up immediately.</p>

    <div>REPORT OF THE DISSECTION.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>On Sunday the 27th of March, 1808, at noon, <i>Dr. Rutter</i> was desired
by the Coroner of Liverpool to take with him an experienced surgeon to
the house of <i>Mr. Charles Angus</i>, and there to examine the body of a
young lady who had died suddenly.</p>

<p class='c000'>The examination was made at two o’clock the same day, by <i>Mr. Hay</i>,
a surgeon in Liverpool, with his apprentice, in company with <i>Dr. Rutter</i>
and <i>Dr. Gerard</i>; and the following report on the subject was presented
to the coroner in writing.</p>

<p class='c000'>“On our arrival at the house, we were introduced into a parlour,
where we found <i>Mr. Angus</i>, with some other persons to us unknown;
and we delivered to him the note from the coroner as the authority
under which we acted. Upon perusing it, he expressed perfect willingness
that the examination should be made. We were then introduced
into the room up stairs, were the body of the deceased was laid. After
having removed the body, a small stain of blood was observed on the
sheet of the bed on which it had laid; and the pillow was stained with
a fluid which had issued from the head. The body being laid on a table,
a large quantity of a thin yellowish fluid poured out from the nostrils,
and was collected in vessels. No marks of external violence were discovered
on the body; nor was there any appearance of commencing putrefaction.
The nails of the fingers were of a bluish colour; and the
veins on the external surface of the <i>abdomen</i> or belly appeared to be much
enlarged. At this period we were joined by <i>Mr. Christian</i>, surgeon.
On opening the <i>abdomen</i>, a considerable quantity of fluid was found to
have been effused into that cavity, similar in colour and smell to that
which issued from the nostrils, but more turbid. Marks of inflammation
were found on the external or peritoneal coat of different portions
of the small intestines; but the large intestines were free from it. The
external coat of a part of the smaller curvature of the stomach was also
inflamed; and a similar appearance of inflammation was observed on a
small portion of the anterior edge of the liver, directly over the smaller
curvature of the stomach. On raising up the stomach, an opening
through its coats was found in the anterior and inferior part of its great
curvature; and from this opening a considerable quantity of a thick
fluid of a dark olive colour issued; of which fluid some ounces were
collected and preserved. The natural structure of the coats of the stomach
for a considerable space around this opening was destroyed; and
they were so soft, pulpy, and tender, that they <a id='tor'></a>tore with the slightest
touch. Around this part of the coats of the stomach, there were no
traces of inflammation whatever. The stomach was then taken out of
the body; and its inner surface was carefully washed; and the contents
washed out were preserved. A quantity, about three ounces, of a fluid
resembling that in the stomach, but not quite so thick, was also taken
out of one of the small intestines, and preserved.</p>

<p class='c000'>“On examining the womb, it was found to be very considerably
enlarged, and, on its inner surface, the part to which the <i>Placenta</i>, or
after-birth, had adhered, was very plainly discernible. This part was
nearly circular, and occupied a space of about four inches in diameter.
The mouth of the womb was greatly dilated. In a word, the appearances
of the womb were such as might have been expected a few hours
after the birth of a child nearly full grown.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The fluid taken out of the stomach and intestines, and cavity of the
<i>Abdomen</i>, as well as that collected from the nostrils, was taken away:
and, afterwards, in the course of the same day, examined, and subjected
to various trials, with a view to discover the presence of such mineral
substances as were likely to produce appearances or effects similar
to those which were found in the stomach of the deceased. In this examination,
we thought it right to request the assistance of <i>Dr. Bostock</i>.
The contents of the stomach were, as has already been mentioned, of a
dirty olive colour, thick, and of an acid smell. A considerable number
of large globules of a dark coloured, dense, oily fluid, floated upon
them; but no particular smell that we could discover. We could not
discover, in the contents of the stomach, by the smell, the presence of
any known vegetable substance, capable of producing deleterious effects
when introduced into it. The fluid contained in the stomach deposited
no sediment; nor was any but a mucous sediment found in the water
with which the inner surface of the stomach was washed. Upon subjecting
the contents of the stomach, in the state in which we found them,
to such tests as are deemed sufficient to detect the presence of any active
preparation of Mercury or Arsenic, we could not detect either of these
substances. The contents of the stomach were then filtered, and subjected
to the same trials, but with the same result. These trials were
made at <i>Dr. Bostock’s</i>, in the presence of <i>Dr. Gerard</i> and <i>Dr. Rutter</i>.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The substance of this report was afterwards delivered, in evidence,
on the trial; and the following additional circumstances stated.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The preternatural opening in the stomach was larger than a crown
piece; but <i>Mr. Hay</i> thinks he may have increased it in drawing down
the stomach, as it was nearly in the centre of the disorganized portion,
where the coats were thin, soft, and semi-transparent. The stomach
was nearly full of the fluid described, but not distended. The intestines
also contained a great deal of a similar fluid; and the internal villous
coat of the duodenum was slightly inflamed, while its external coat
was also more inflamed than that of the other intestines.”</p>

<p class='c000'>In consequence of the suspicious circumstances attending the death of
<i>Miss Burns</i>, <i>Charles Angus</i> was indicted for her murder; but, after a
trial which occupied the court from eight o’clock on Friday morning,
until three on Saturday, the 2d of September, 1808, the prisoner was
acquitted.</p>

<p class='c000'>The medical defence, conducted by <i>Dr. Carson</i>, and which savoured
more of the ingenuity of the forensic pleader, than the justice of the
honest inquirer after truth, rested upon the following grounds, viz. 1.
The appearances of the stomach upon dissection are to be reconciled upon
the supposition of the dissolution of its coats having taken place, <em>after death</em>,
in consequence of the action of the gastric fluid. 2. The symptoms which
preceded death were not such as accompany corrosive poisoning. 3.
No poisonous substance was detected in the body. 4. The appearance
of the uterus does not justify the conclusion that a delivery had recently
taken place; such a dilated state of the organ, had it lately parted with
a placenta, must have occasioned death by hemorrhage, or it must
have been found gorged with coagulated blood. 5. The appearances
may be reconciled by supposing that an expulsion of hydatids had taken
place.</p>

<p class='c000'>We must not omit to state, that in consequence of the intense interest
excited by this trial, the ovaria were subsequently examined, when a
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">corpus luteum</span></i> was discovered.</p>

<p class='c000'>We cannot conclude this account without expressing a regret that several
important sources of information should have been neglected. The
omitting to inspect the appendages of the uterus, to examine the œsophagus,
the chest, and the head, and to analyse the membranes of the stomach,
are instances of inattention, for which it is not easy to find an
excuse. May they furnish a salutary lesson for future anatomists.</p>

One example will suffice.—Several substances have gained the reputation
of Styptics, from the effects which have followed their application
to the wounded and bleeding vessels in the extremities of the horse and
ass; whereas the fact is that the blood-vessels of these animals possess a
power of contraction which does not exist in those of man, and to which
the cessation of the hemorrhage, fallaciously attributed to the styptic,
is to be wholly attributed.</p>

Lib. 27. Cap. 2.) to have been particularly skilled in such a process,
and to have murdered many of his wives when asleep, by
bathing the parts of generation with the juice of Aconite; and Dr.
<i>Gordon Smith</i>, in his work on Forensic Medicine, relates, on the authority
of <i>Schenckius</i>, the tragical death of <i>Ladislas</i>, or <i>Lancelot</i>, surnamed the
Victorious and the Liberal, who succeeded to the contested throne of
Naples in 1386, and died at the age of thirty-eight in great pain, in
consequence of having been poisoned by the daughter of a physician,
of whom he was passionately fond, <i>per concubitum</i>. Sir <i>Thomas Brown</i>,
in his <i>Vulgar Errors</i>, alludes to an ancient story of an “Indian king
that sent unto <i>Alexander</i> a fair woman, <em>fed with Aconites</em>, and other poisons,
with the intent that she either by converse or <em>copulation</em> might
destroy him.”</p>

the heated end pinched by the tongs, and at the same time bent up at
an acute angle, so as to be brought parallel to the body of the tube. The
tube is then to be heated a second time, and being again firmly pinched
by the hot tongs, the end will be found to be completely impervious.</p>

and Dr. Jaeger, in his Thesis, before quoted, observes that he has been
enabled to recognise the tenth of a grain of arsenious acid, although
mixed with sugar, by its odour, when thrown upon burning coals!
We must be allowed to question this fact; Dr. Jaeger, no doubt, believed
that he recognised the alliaceous odour, but it must have been
the sole effect of the imagination. Dr. Bostock states that such a test is
not to be depended upon; for, unless the arsenic be in considerable
quantity, the odour is not sufficiently perceptible; and if it be mixed
with either an animal or a vegetable substance, the smoke and smell
arising from these bodies, when heated, will altogether prevent our recognising
the peculiar odour of the arsenic. When a quantity of arsenic
is mixed with an equal weight of flour, and placed upon iron at a
low red heat, so as not to cause the flour to inflame, the suffocating
smoke that arises from the latter can be alone perceived; nor is it possible
to discover that any thing has been mixed with it. <cite>Edinb. Med.
Journ.</cite> <i>l. c.</i> This last objection of Dr. Bostock is true in fact, although
it admits of a different explanation, for at a low temperature the arsenious
acid will be volatilized <em>without decomposition</em>; in which case no alliaceous
odour can be developed.</p>

assayed by the nitrate of silver, it may be considered as the effects of
some casual impurity; this may be farther demonstrated by bringing
over the surface of the arsenical liquid, a piece of blotting paper, or a
stopper moistened with a solution of ammonia, when there will instantly
form a copious yellow precipitate of arsenite of silver. If this
experiment be performed by spreading the mixed solutions of arsenious
acid and nitrate of silver over a surface of glass, laid upon white
paper, the result will be most striking and beautiful, for on slowly
bringing the ammoniacal test over it, the yellow cloud will gradually
diffuse itself over the surface.</p>

<p class='c000'><a href='#r254'>254</a>. The following is the formula for its preparation. Dissolve ten
grains of <i>lunar caustic</i>, in ten times its weight of distilled water; to this
add, <i>guttatim</i>, liquid ammonia, until a precipitate is formed; continue
cautiously to add the ammonia, repeatedly agitating the mixture until
the precipitate is nearly redissolved. The object of allowing a small
portion to remain undissolved is, to guard against an excess of ammonia.
Wherever the test is used, the liquid to which it is added ought
to be quite cold.</p>
</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f255'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r255'>255</a>. This is very important, for an excess of ammonia redissolves the
yellow precipitate, and therefore defeats the object of the test. The
fixed alkalies, in excess, have not such a property.</p>
</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f256'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r256'>256</a>. The great impression made upon the public mind in Cornwall by
the above trial, produced a disposition to regard every sudden death
with more than usual jealousy. In consequence, therefore, of a report
having arisen that a young woman had died after an illness of forty-eight
hours, and been hastily buried at Madron, near Penzance, the
magistrates of that district issued their warrant for the disinterment of
the body, and requested the author’s attendance at the examination.
The dissection was accordingly conducted in the church, when it appeared
that the immediate cause of death had been an inflammation of the
intestines; the stomach was found to contain a considerable portion
of liquid, which was carefully collected and examined; no solid matter
could be <a id='dis'></a>discovered in it, nor were any particles found to be adhering
to the coats of the stomach. The fluid appeared to consist principally
of the remains of a quantity of pennyroyal tea, which had been the last
thing administered to the deceased. This was divided into several
distinct portions, and placed in separate wine glasses, and submitted,
in the presence of the High Sheriff, and some other gentlemen whose
curiosity had been excited by the late trial of <i>Donnall</i>, to a series of experiments,
amongst which the following may be particularized, as
bearing upon the present question, and as affording an important elucidation
of it.</p>

<p class='c000'>A few drops of a solution of <i>sub-carbonate of potass</i> were added to the
liquid, in one of the glasses, when its colour, which was originally of a
light hazel, was instantly deepened into a reddish yellow; the sulphate
of copper was then applied, when a precipitate fell down, which every
one present simultaneously pronounced to be of a “<em>vivid grass green</em>”
hue; but, on pouring off the supernatant liquid, and transferring the
precipitate upon a sheet of white paper, it assumed the blue colour
which is so characteristic of the <i>carbonate of copper</i>. The explanation of
the phenomenon, and the fallacy to which it gave rise, became obvious;
the yellow colour imparted to the liquid by the alkali, was the effect
of the latter body upon the vegetable extractive matter of the infusion.
The other portions were then strictly examined, but no indications
of arsenic or any other metallic poison were discovered.</p>
</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f257'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r257'>257</a>. This explanation applies equally to the objection lately advanced
by <i>Dr. Porter</i>, of the University of South Carolina, who, in his observations
on the tests of arsenic, remarks, that an appearance similar to
“<i>Scheele’s Green</i>,” is produced by the carbonate of potass, when added
to a solution of the sulphate of copper in coffee, but without arsenic,
more striking than if even a weak solution of arsenic were used.
<cite>Silliman’s Journal</cite>, iii. 865.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Fodere</span> reports a case, in which an erroneous conclusion respecting
the presence of arsenic was drawn, evidently owing to the same source
of fallacy. The Society of Medicine at Marseilles, in consequence of a
girl having been poisoned by a quack medicine, appointed a scientific
person to examine the composition of the <i>Nostrum</i>; this person, strongly
prepossessed with the opinion that it contained arsenic, applied the
<em>copper test</em> above described, and having obtained by means of it, a <em>green
precipitate</em>, reported, without any further inquiry, that the medicine in
question was an arsenical solution. <i>Foderé</i>, however, suspected the
correctness of the conclusion, in consequence of the residue not yielding
by combustion, any alliaceous odour; a new analysis was therefore
made, which proved the nostrum to be nothing more than a very
strong alcoholic tincture of colocynth. <cite>Médecine Légale, tom. iv. p.</cite> 137.</p>
</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f258'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r258'>258</a>. It is hardly necessary to observe that neither the carbonate of
ammonia or of potass, or sulphuric or muriatic acid, produce any
effect whatever in a pure solution of white arsenic.</p>
</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f259'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r259'>259</a>. Corrosive sublimate, however, produces both these effects, from
causes which we have fully explained under the consideration of that
poison.</p>

<p class='c000'><a href='#r280'>280</a>. We find in an ancient epigram of Ausonius, that a woman gave
to her husband some metallic mercury, with the design of increasing
the energy of a certain poison, which she administered to him. But
instead of producing this effect, the mercury, on the contrary, entirely
re-established the health of the person poisoned. The celebrated <i>Goethe</i>
upon asking the Professor <i>Doebereiner</i> of Jena, his opinion upon the
above case, received in reply, that the poison must have been corrosive
sublimate, since, of all the known poisons, it was the only one whose
power was weakened by mercury.</p>

<p class='c000'><a href='#r283'>283</a>. Trial of Mary <i>Bateman</i> for the wilful murder of <i>Rebecca Perigo</i>,
at the York Assizes, 1809. As we have on several occasions alluded
to this trial, it may perhaps be satisfactory to give a short sketch of
the case in this place.</p>

<p class='c000'>This diabolical woman, under the pretext of possessing the art of witchcraft,
committed numerous frauds, and worked with so much success
upon the credulity of her victims, as to obtain considerable sums of
money, and reduce them to the extremes of poverty; while, in order to
conceal the frauds, she consigned whole families to the grave by her poisons.
Her detection was brought about by the robbery of a family of the
name of <i>Perigo</i>, from whom she obtained the sum of seventy pounds, besides
cloathes and furniture, under the pretence of engaging a Miss <i>Blythe</i>
to relieve <i>Perigo’s</i> wife from the effects of an “evil wish,” under which
she was supposed to labour; when the appointed time arrived for the
restoration of the property, and the promised cure of the wife, <i>Mary
Bateman</i> sent a powder (<i>Arsenic</i>) which she directed them to add to their
pudding, and advised them, should they be ill after eating it, to take a
spoonful of prepared honey with which she supplied them. The wife
ate the pudding, and soon afterwards died; the husband, however,
very narrowly escaped: for this murder she was tried and convicted;
and thus was a system of robbery and murder, scarcely equalled in the
annals of crime, happily exposed and ended.</p>

is to be found from a Mr. <i>Murray</i>, which would have been too
ridiculous to require notice, had it not involved a question connected
with the habitudes of corrosive sublimate and iron, which might possibly
occasion error. After stating that certain metallic solutions may be
decomposed through the agency of magnetism, he says, a solution of
corrosive sublimate may be thus made to yield metallic mercury, by introducing
into it a bar of magnetised iron! He had not the wit to inquire
whether unmagnetised iron might not prove equally powerful
as a decomposing agent.</p>

<p class='c000'><a href='#r358'>358</a>. Sir <i>George Baker</i> considered that the dry belly ache, which is common
to the drinkers of <em>new</em> rum, in the West Indies, ought to be wholly
referred to its contamination with lead.</p>

<p class='c000'><a href='#r359'>359</a>. The art of glazing earthenware with lead is of modern invention;
that part of the old earthenware, preserved in the British museum,
which is supposed to have been of Roman manufacture, is not glazed.
The vessels, which are called Etruscan, and which are supposed to
be of greater antiquity than the Roman, have indeed a paint or polish
on their surfaces; but that does not appear to resemble our modern saturnine
vitrification.</p>
</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f360'>

great part of New Castille in Spain, were harrassed with colic, as recorded
by <i>M. Thierry</i>, received a satisfactory explanation from the fact
of glazed earthenware having been universally used in that country for
culinary vessels.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Sir G. Baker</i> in a paper entitled “<cite>Further Observations on the Poisons
of Lead</cite>,” Med. Trans. vol. 2, p. 419, mentions the practice of drinking
cyder out of glazed earthen vessels as dangerous. Dr. <i>Watson</i>, junior,
saw several instances of the Devonshire colic, during the time of harvest,
apparently from this cause. And a similar instance fell under the
notice of Dr. <i>Charleston</i>, where six persons became, at one time, paralytic,
by drinking cyder, brought to them while at harvest work, in a
new earthen pitcher, the inside of which was glazed. That the glazing
was dissolved by the liquor appeared not only by the effects which it
produced, but from its having given, as these persons informed Dr.
<i>Charleston</i>, that astringent sweetish taste to the liquor, by which the solutions
of this metal are so peculiarly distinguished.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f367'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r367'>367</a>. <i>Francis Citois</i>, the historian of this celebrated epidemic, published
his “<cite>Diatriba de novo et populari apud Pictones, dolore colico bilioso</cite>,” A.D.
1617. In which he states that the “<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">dolor colicus Pictonicus</span></i>” was a new
epidemic in the province of Poitou, about the year 1572; and after having
prevailed in that province about 60 or 70 years, it became milder,
less untractable, and by degrees was translated to other parts of France.
The supposition, however, says Sir <i>George Baker</i>, that the colic of Poitou
was a new disease, about the time when Citois lived, is not true; the
disease was even mentioned by our countryman <i>John of Gaddesden</i>, who
appears to have written his <i>Rosa Anglica</i> early in the fourteenth century.
If we consult authors posterior to <i>Citois</i>, we find this species of colic
mentioned in almost every practical book. We have an account in <i>Sennertus</i>
of its having prevailed epidemically, all over Silesia, in the year
1621. <i>Baglivi</i> even affirms that “nihil facilius colicæ supervenit, quam
paralysis.” None of these authors, however, appear to have entertained
the slightest suspicion of the true source of the malady.</p>

<p class='c000'><a href='#r417'>417</a>. It may be obtained from opium by the following process, invented
by <span class='sc'>Robiquet</span>. Three hundred parts of pure opium are to be
macerated during five days, in one thousand parts of common water;
to the filtered solution, fifteen parts of perfectly pure magnesia (carefully
avoiding the <i>carbonate</i>) are to be added; boil this mixture (A) for
ten minutes, and separate the sediment (B) by a filter, washing it with
cold water until the water passes off clear; after which, treat it alternately
with hot and cold alcohol (12, 22. Bé) as long as the menstruum
takes up any colouring matter; the residue is then to be treated
with boiling alcohol (22, 32, Bé) on cooling, the solution will deposit
the <i>Morphia</i> in crystals.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Rationale of the process.</i> A soluble <i>meconiate of magnesia</i> is, in the first
place, formed; (A) while the sediment (B) consists of <i>morphia</i>, in the
state of mixture, with the excess of magnesia; the boiling alcohol, with
which this residuum is treated, exerts no action upon the magnesia, but
dissolves the <i>morphia</i>, and, on cooling, surrenders it in a crystalline state.</p>

<p class='c000'><a href='#r446'>446</a>. In 1624 Pope Urban the VIII, published a decree of excommunication
against all who took snuff in the church. Ten years after this,
smoking tobacco was forbidden in Russia, under the pain of having the
nose cut off. In 1653 the Council of the Canton of Appenzel cited
smokers before them, whom they punished; and they ordered all inn-keepers
to inform against such as were found smoking in their houses.
The police regulations of Berne, made in 1661, were divided according
to the ten commandments, in which the prohibition of smoking stood
immediately beneath the command against adultery. This prohibition
was renewed in 1675, and the tribunal instituted to put it into execution—viz.
“<span class='sc'>Chambre au Tabac</span>,” continued to the middle of the
eighteenth century. Pope Innocent the XII, in 1590 excommunicated
all those who were found taking snuff, or using tobacco, in any manner,
in the church of St. Peter at Rome; even so late as 1719 the Senate of
Strasburgh prohibited the cultivation of tobacco, from an apprehension
that it would diminish the growth of corn. Amurath the IV published
an edict which made the smoking tobacco a capital offence; this was
founded on an opinion that it rendered the people infertile.</p>

carefully performed on an animal under such circumstances

up an artificial breathing, until the effects of the narcotic have passed

grinding steel; the workmen are usually attacked by what is called the
grinder’s asthma at twenty-five or thirty years of age, and few of them
live to forty. The Society of Arts have long offered a reward for the
invention of some mode of securing the workmen from this dreadful
calamity, and in 1822 awarded their gold medal to <i>Mr. J. H. Abraham</i>,
of Sheffield, for his Magnetic Guard for Needle-pointers, (see Transactions
for 1822.) The contrivance is likely to answer its intended purpose,
provided the obstinacy and prejudice of the workmen can be overcome

employed under them, even though their servants should themselves

clean dry bottle, capable of holding about six ounces, and formed a
stratum at the bottom not one-eighth of an inch in thickness; particular
care was taken that none of the mercury should adhere to the upper
part of the inside of the bottle. A small piece of leaf-gold was then
attached to the under part of the stopper of the bottle, so that when the
stopper was put into its place, the leaf-gold was enclosed in the bottle.
It was then set aside in a safe place, which happened to be both dark
and cool, and left for between six weeks and two months. At the end
of that time it was examined, and the leaf-gold was found whitened by
a quantity of mercury, though every part of the bottle and mercury remained,
apparently, just as before. This experiment has been repeated
several times, and always with success. The utmost care was taken
that mercury should not get to the gold, except by passing through
the atmosphere of the bottle. I think therefore it proves that at common
temperatures, and even when the air is present, mercury is always
surrounded by an atmosphere of the same substance.”—<cite>On the vapour of
